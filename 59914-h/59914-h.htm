<h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>
<p>Much of the material used in this study was gathered while the writer
was engaged by the National Park Service in Zion Canyon, and he himself
participated in many of the events described in the latter pages. The foundation
for understanding the historical background, however, was laid during
his early life in St. George and the surrounding region. Expressions and
opinions have been interpreted largely through that experience.</p>
<p>The writer was acquainted with many of the early Dixie settlers, and notes
of interviews with some of these have furnished details otherwise unobtainable.
Personal letters also have filled in many gaps.</p>
<p>Additional source material has been obtained from the Office of the Adjutant
General of Utah, the Salt Lake Public Library, the libraries of the University
of Utah and Dixie Junior College, newspaper files, published books,
unpublished manuscripts, original journals or extracts, records of the National
Park Service, the United States Land Office and in the L.D.S. Church Historian&rsquo;s
Office, Salt Lake City, the &ldquo;Journal History,&rdquo; (a collection of extracts
from journals and newspapers arranged chronologically) proved to be a fruitful
source of information. This was supplemented by access to additional reports,
publications and records of the St. George L.D.S. Temple, compiled by
James G. Bleak.</p>
<p>The writer is grateful to many for their encouragement, advice, information,
pictures, reading and criticism of the manuscript. He is particularly indebted
to Dr. H. E. Gregory, Horace M. Albright, Randall L. Jones, D. D.
Rust, H. L. Reid, J. W. Thornton, Zaidee Walker Miles, J. Cecil Alter and
Miss Marguerite L. Sinclair, Secretary of the Utah State Historical Society.
Further assistance came from William W. Seegmiller, Frederick S. Dellenbaugh,
Frederick Vining Fisher, Dr. J. K. W. Bracken, Lawrence S. Mariger,

<h2><span class="small">A HISTORY OF SOUTHERN UTAH</span>
<br />and
<br />ITS NATIONAL PARKS

</div>
<div class="fnblock"><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a>Angus M. Woodbury was born of pioneer parents in St. George, Utah,
July 11, 1886. His early education was obtained in the schools of his native
town and Salt Lake City, and he was graduated from Brigham Young Academy,
Provo, in 1906. Two years later he joined the U. S. National Forest Service,
and in the varied employments of this work, gradually developed the dominant
interest of his life, the natural history of the West. For a brief season, 1920-21,
he tried stock-breeding on his father&rsquo;s farm at St. George, but soon returned to
his major interest, pursued further studies at Dixie College, and was active in
the naturalist service of Zion National Park from 1925 to 1933. In 1928 he received
his Master&rsquo;s degree from the University of Utah, and in 1931 his
doctorate from the University of California. He has been a member of the
faculty of the University of Utah since 1927, and has done much to develop
and strengthen its biological and zoological departments while keeping in close
touch with field work in Southern Utah. He has published numerous monographs
and studies dealing with the biota, fauna and flora of the West, and has
achieved national recognition for the scientific accuracy of his reportings. His
interest in the history of Southern Utah has always been keen, and in 1931 he
published in the <i>Utah Historical Quarterly</i> (Vol. IV, pp. 35-46) a study entitled
&ldquo;The Route of Jedediah S. Smith in 1826 from the Great Salt Lake.&rdquo; This
present work is a summary of data, most of which was accumulated for use in
his work as naturalist in Zion Canyon, but which has been checked and elaborated
since. In January, 1909, Dr. Woodbury married Grace Atkin, descendant
of Charles L. Walker, pioneer St. George wit and poet. Together they make
their home in Salt Lake City, and are the parents of six children.

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">The Indian Heritage</span></h2>
<p>Zion Canyon had already been carved half-a-mile deep in
the brilliant Navajo sandstone and most of its geological history
had passed long before the eyes of man beheld its glory. One of
the world&rsquo;s rare beauty spots, lying within Zion National Park
in southwestern Utah, it serves as a striking example of the thousands
of flaming gorges or red box canyons eroded through millions
of years on the edges of the plateaus along the Colorado
River in southern Utah and northern Arizona.</p>
<p>Prehistoric man came and left his ruins, relics and pictographs
strewn along the floor of the canyon, hidden under sheltering
arches and boulders, buried in mounds or etched on the faces
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
of the cliffs. Myths, legends and traditions played their part
in linking the ancient inhabitants with the modern Indians.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that primitive cliff dwellers used to live in
Zion Canyon, the Indians of more recent date appear to have
avoided it as a camping ground. There seems to have been something
mysterious and foreboding in the gloomy depths of twilight
and darkness that appalled these semi-savages. So far as can
be determined from both Indians and early white settlers, the
natives especially avoided the canyon after sundown. O. D.
Gifford, a pioneer of Springdale, says they never camped above
its mouth. They would go up the canyon in the daylight but invariably
would come back before dark.</p>
<p>E. C. Behunin, who lived in Zion Canyon from 1862 to 1872,
says he never saw an Indian come above Springdale, and although
his father tried to induce Indians to work for him, they could never
be persuaded to venture into the upper part of the canyon. John
Dennett, who farmed in Zion for many years after 1875, says the
Indians never raised crops in Zion, except the little they did for
the white settlers; and that they were very superstitious about the
canyon. Other early settlers add the same testimony.</p>
<p>Tony Tillohash, an educated Shivwits Indian, says an Indian
would not dare go alone into Zion Canyon. The solitary traveler
might be killed without warning. Kai-ne-sava was not the main
spirit in the supernatural hierarchy of the Paiute, an honor reserved
for the Wolf-god, variously rendered as Shin-na&prime;-wav or
Sin-na&prime;-wava. Rather, Kai-ne-sava was a mysterious being of
changeable moods. There was no assurance of his friendship
and he had to be propitiated. He might whistle or yell at
any moment while remaining invisible. Again, he might reveal
himself in the distance in human form and then disappear when
approached. His movement might stir up a whirlwind of dust and
then trail away into nothing. Sometimes he built fires (lightning)
on the West Temple or other places inaccessible to human beings.
The smoke from fires on the West Temple could be seen for many
miles in every direction. Kai-ne-sava then was sending a message.</p>
<p>He pushed the rocks that fall down in Zion. His mood might
be capricious. If so, the Indians must keep out of the way. Then
it was no use to hunt, for Kai-ne-sava would frighten the deer
before the Indian could get close enough to shoot. Sometimes
he would tantalize by taking the form of a big buck deer with
spreading antlers, and would hide and jump out in front of the
Indians with such great bounds that they could not pierce him with
their arrows no matter what their skill. On such days it was
better to go home.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in a friendly mood Kai-ne-sava might be extremely
helpful. He could soothe the deer so they were not frightened
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
and lure them where they were easily found. Then the Indians
could shoot their arrows with assurance of killing. Such good
fortune the Indians did not forget. A bounteous kill they were willing
to share with Kai-ne-sava. To show their appreciation, little
pieces of meat were laid out here and there for him. When they
returned, the meat was always gone, hence Kai-ne-sava must have
taken it.</p>
<p>Although Kai-ne-sava was fond of playing pranks, he was
often kind and pleasant. This is in marked contrast with another
supernatural being who was always at cross purposes and who
caused the Indians no end of trouble. This was Wai-no-pits, who
lurked in gloomy shadows and was always intent on evil. It was
sometimes hard to distinguish between the pranks of Kai-ne-sava
and the evil doings of Wai-no-pits. There seems to have been
some confusion in the minds of the Indians. The one was to be
propitiated, the other avoided.</p>
<p>Wai-no-pits might visit a camp and bring sickness to it. He
might cause an accident or waylay the Indians with all sorts of dire
calamities. Wherever his presence was suspected it was best to
run away.</p>
<p>The Wolf-god (Shin-na&prime;-wav), on the other hand, was the
friendly one. There was no fear of him, but he was more distant
and less distinctly defined. There were legends connecting him
with the past history of the Paiute Indians and his influence was
more or less mysterious. While his friendly acts were to be appreciated
it was not always possible to distinguish his manifestations
from those of Kai-ne-sava.</p>
<p>These supernatural beings, apparently, were not familiar
spirits. Never were they directly encountered. Their manifestations
were veiled and it was only by signs and implications that
they could be interpreted. Anything not clearly comprehended
was likely to be interpreted by the Indian as a manifestation of the
preternatural. Zion Canyon was full of mystery; it was a place
where anything might happen, especially in the shadows and darkness.
The fear of Wai-no-pits or of Kai-ne-sava in his austere
moods more than offset the assurance of Shin-na-wav or of Kai-ne-sava
propitiated. Small wonder the superstitious Indian tried to
avoid Zion Canyon, especially when night had fallen in its awesome
depths.</p>
<p>The Paiute, himself extremely primitive, contributed not a
little to our culture in the way of an early knowledge of geography
and routes of travel, place names and a heritage of traditions.
Most of the pioneers explored these new regions and traveled
new routes largely or partly with the aid of Indian guides or
advice. Without such assistance, the explorers many times wandered
from the proper route, lost valuable time, and encountered
dangers and hardships that could have been avoided. Escalante
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
tells us in 1776 that with proper Indian guidance he could have
covered in three days the Arizona Strip which in his wanderings
required ten. Geographical knowledge thus acquired wove itself
into our culture through personal contact, writings and maps that
have since been passed on from generation to generation.</p>
<p>Many Indian geographical names, anglicized or unchanged,
have been perpetuated in our nomenclature; for example, Toquerville,
named for Indian chief Toquer, Kaibab (big flat mountain
or mountain lying down), Kanarra (also named for an Indian
chief), Shunesburg (an abandoned village named for an old
Indian who lived there), Parunuweap (canyon with a swift stream
of water), Kanab (meaning willow; there were many of them
growing there when the town was first settled), and Paria or
Pahrea (meaning a settlement and plateau). The name Mukuntuweap,
pronounced Mu-koon-tu-weap, without accent, is undoubtedly
of Indian origin, but there has been much dispute as to
its derivation and application.</p>
<p>Originally applied by Major Powell to both Zion Canyon
and the river flowing through it, the name is now restricted to
the latter. Some of the early white settlers suggest that it means
&ldquo;the place of the gods&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;God&rsquo;s land.&rdquo; This interpretation,
however, seems to have no real foundation. Both Indians
and whites appear to be in complete agreement that tu-weap
means ground, earth, or place. It is the rest of the word which
is in doubt. William W. Seegmiller, who is familiar with the
Indian language, is of the opinion that it is named for a chief of
the Virgin River Indians named Mukun, and therefore simply
means the land of Mukun.</p>
<p>Old George of the Kaibab Indians pronounced it Mukoontau&prime;-weap,
with accent on tau, and said it meant straight canyon.
William R. Palmer, also an authority on Paiute lore, concludes
that there are two possibilities: one, that it is derived from the
Indian word yucca or oose, muk-unk, the whole word muk-unk-o-weap,
thus meaning Oose Creek (or since the oose was sometimes
used for soap simply Soap Creek); and the other derived
from Muk-unt-o-weap, meaning straight canyon. Major Powell
(September 12, 1872) says, &ldquo;The Indians call the canyon through
which it [the river] runs, Mu-koon-tu-weap, or Straight Canyon.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Several of the better informed Indians on the Shivwits Reservation
near Santa Clara did not recognize the word Mukuntuweap.
Tommy Mayo pronounced it Huh-cut-u-weap, and said it
meant red dirt, red country, or place of red soil. Frank Mustache
pronounced it Un-ga-tu-weap and gave its meaning as red dirt.
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
Tony Tillohash gave a different version, pronouncing it huh-kon-tu-weap,
meaning a big canyon.</p>
<p>The confusion is further increased by suggestions of other
names. Frank Mustache says the Indians called Zion Canyon,
Un[k]ga-timpe pai-ave, (unka or unga, meaning red, timpe rock,
and pai-ave signifying a canyon between mountains, the whole
meaning a big, red rock canyon). Several Indians referred to the
Canyon as I-u-goon. Nearly all of them agreed that Pahroos was
the proper name for the Virgin River, meaning a swift stream of
rippling or turbulent water, bounding or foaming over the rocks
as it does in Zion Canyon.</p>
<p>The discrepancies are partly explained by the common Indian
custom of naming places from some striking local characteristic.
Different communities impressed by various facets of a
canyon like Zion may have given different names to the same
thing. Some, remarking the resemblance of the canyon to an
arrow quiver, called it I-u-goon. Those who gathered yucca
root for soap may have referred to it as Muk-unk-o-weap. Those
who recognized Mukun as a great leader may have used the
name Mukuntuweap. Those who looked down from Cedar
Mountain into the straight, deep canyon of Zion, probably said
Mukuntoweap. Others thinking of the high, red walls could
scarcely refrain from using the Indian term, unka or unga, meaning
red. Hence we have several variations of Unkatuweap, or
even Unga-timpe pai-ave.</p>
<p>The Indians encountered by the early white explorers were
Parrusits living in scattered bands along the upper Virgin River
and forming one of the dozen or more clans belonging to the
Paiute tribe. This tribe occupied the land lying west of the
mountains and south of the high plateaus of southern Utah from
Pahvant Valley (Millard County) southward to the Colorado
River in Arizona and reaching westward into Nevada as far as
the mouth of the Virgin River. The Paiute tribe was one of five
belonging to the Ute Nation, occupying a vast territory extending
to the north and east.</p>
<p>The chief of the Utes, whose headquarters were in central
Utah, dominated the whole nation and was at liberty to come and
go without restraint throughout his domain and to levy such tribute
as he desired. The suffragan chiefs could do the same within
their tribal limits. Natural resources belonged to the community
and no individual could claim property other than personal effects,
such as horses, arms, wickiups and food supplies.</p>
<p>Each tribe had definite boundaries and members of one could
not encroach upon the lands of another without permission, else
resentment might lead to war. Each clan or community within
a tribe also had a definite area claimed as its own, the limits of
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
which were settled by agreement or war, and were clearly understood.
Anyone entering foreign territory to hunt or fish without
permission was regarded as an illegal trespasser and it was proper
to make war upon him and even to kill him. Frequently the
whites got into difficulties by not observing these Indian laws and
customs.</p>
<p>When Indians of one group entered the territory of another,
it was obligatory for them to go through a fixed ritual to obtain
permission to do so. Once this ritual had been fulfilled the visitors
were under tribal protection and any loss or injury must be
made good by the tribe. Without such promise and protection,
anything might happen. In recompense some sort of gift was
usually expected.</p>
<p>If, during times of peace, a tribesman injured or killed another,
satisfaction had to be rendered to the family, friends or
tribe of the victim. It was usually required on the principle of an
eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, but occasionally other bargains
were made. A slain man&rsquo;s relatives ordinarily demanded
the culprit or a relative, even though they sometimes had to be
satisfied with a weakling, a cripple, or an aged person of little
value to the tribe.</p>
<p>The early settlers of Rockville discovered the weightiness
of this Indian law. One day in February, 1869, Tom Flanigan
and Sam Green were carrying express from Rockville to Pipe
Springs, where they were met at dusk by two Indians. Flanigan,
thinking in his excitement that something was amiss, shot one of
them. The Indian was badly wounded and died a few days later
in spite of all the care given him after he was taken back to Rockville.
The Indians demanded that Flanigan surrender to be tortured
and killed in satisfaction. This was of course refused. A
crowd of Indians gathered and the situation was tense. The affair,
however, was finally compromised by delivering to the Indians
an ox.</p>
<p>The Paiutes formed a sparse population spread out over a
large territory. Depending mostly upon natural foods and but
little upon cultivated crops, they were limited in numbers by the
scanty resources of this semi-arid or desert region. Their weakness
made them a prey to stronger marauding neighbors such as
the Navajos. They were so poor they could seldom pay the tax
levied by the chief of the Ute nation and usually gave children
as slaves in lieu of other tribute. Failing this, they were in danger
of having their women and children stolen.</p>
<p>The Paiute tribe had a number of subdivisions or clans loosely
held together by the tribal government. There is a difference
of opinion about the identity of the tribal chief. William R.
Palmer states that the chief was the leader of the strong Com-o-its
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
clan living in the region of Cedar City.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> There is evidence, however,
that the Virgin River Indians (the Parrusits) were dominated
by a chief of the band living on the Santa Clara sometimes
referred to as the Tonaquintits. Nearly all the historical data of
the early settlement of the Virgin River indicate that the Paiutes
recognized this leadership and not that of the Com-o-its. Neighboring
clans included the Shivwits (Shebits) of the Parashont,
the Uinkarets of the Trumbull and the Kaibabits of the Kaibab
region, all occupying the &ldquo;Arizona Strip&rdquo; north of the Colorado
River.</p>
<p>The first historical references to these Indians were given
by the Spanish Franciscan, Fray Silvestre Velez de Escalante,
in October, 1776. On the Pilar River (now Ash Creek), below
Toquerville, near its junction with the Virgin River twenty-five
miles below Zion Canyon, he tells us that his party found a well-made
platform with a large supply of ears of corn and corn husks
which had been stored upon it. Nearby on a small flat on the
river bank were three small cornfields with very well made irrigation
ditches. The stalks of the maize which they had raised
that year were still intact. His journal records:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From here down the stream and on the mesa and
on both sides for a long distance, according to what we
learned, these Indians apply themselves to the cultivation
of maize and calabashes. In their own language
they are called Parrusis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next day, October 15, after meeting some of these Indians,
he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... they made us understand that they were called
Parrusis ... and that they were the ones who planted
crops on the banks of the Pilar River and lived down
stream a long distance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still later, on October 19, when he met the Uinkarets Indians
north of Mt. Trumbull, Escalante remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They told us that they were called Yubincariri; that
they did not plant maize; that their foods were those
seeds, tuna,<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> pine nuts, which are scarce judging from
the few they gave us; and such hares, rabbits and wild
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
sheep as they could get by hunting. They added that
on this side of the river [Colorado] only the Parrusis
planted maize and calabashes.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Habits and Customs</span></h2>
<p>The Parrusits, notwithstanding their primitive agriculture,
moved about a great deal within their territory, as the exigencies
of the season, the food supply, sanitary conditions, or their relations
with other Indians demanded. They occasionally went into
the high mountains in summer to hunt or fish but returned at intervals
to the valleys to tend the crops. In the fall they went nut
gathering among the pinyon pines of the foothills. The winters
were usually spent in the valleys.</p>
<p>Their wickiups were made upon a framework of poles lashed
together at the top in such way as to leave an opening for smoke
to escape. The poles, tied with sinew in the conventional tepee
shape, were plied with brush or woven willows and then covered
with long strips of juniper bark or with skins of rabbits. At one
side an opening was left for an entry-way. The fire was built
in the center, leaving space around the sides for eating and
sleeping.</p>
<p>Camps were usually located on a mesa, hill or flat, so that
water had to be carried some distance from stream or spring.
For this purpose, they wove jugs with narrow necks from the
limbs of the squawbush and waterproofed them with pitch from
the pinyon pine. Sinews were tied to the necks of the jugs for
shoulder or head straps. Basketry was competent, but there is
no evidence of pottery among them.</p>
<p>Paiute equipment for life was simple. Clothing consisted
of a breechclout for the men, and for women a brief skirt hanging
from the waist. These were sometimes supplemented by robes
hung from the shoulders for warmth, buckskin moccasins for the
feet, and ornaments of various kinds, particularly beads and
feathers. They had no regular head dress, but often painted
themselves with a special red earth which gave them a weird
appearance. Breechclouts, skirts and robes were usually made
from rabbit skins. In order to have the fur both inside and out,
they would take a strip of fur and roll it in a spiral around a sinew
or yucca fiber. Many such strips sewed together with sinew
thread made a skin cloth from which clothing could be fashioned.</p>
<p>Hunting equipment consisted principally of the bow and
arrow, supplemented by stone skinning knives. Their arrows
were shafted with feathers and tipped with hard wood or stone
points, small ones for birds and small game and larger ones for
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
war or big game, all held in place by sinews. The shaft of the
arrow was made from a straight limb or from reed cane. Sinew
was made by shredding the tendons of deer or other large game.
If arrows were to be poisoned, a concoction was made by inducing
a rattlesnake to bite into a piece of liver, letting it stand a few
days and then mixing it with crushed black widow spiders. Arrow
tips dipped in this were considered deadly.</p>
<p>The Paiutes used the rock grinder or metate and mano for
grinding such foods as corn, mesquite beans, and the coarse grass
seed from which they made bread. The meal was mixed with
water to make a batter and was cooked on a hot rock in the fire.
The rock was first rubbed with clay to keep the meal from sticking.
According to one method, the batter was made thin and
poured over the rock in a flat cake. The heat from the rock soon
set the batter and the rock was then stood upright close to the
fire so the cake would bake on both sides. In the other method,
the batter was made thicker and put out on the rock in the form
of a conical loaf and coals were heaped around it.</p>
<p>Though the Indians raised corn, squash and beans, they
lived principally upon fish, birds, wild game, wild fruits, roots
and seeds. The principal game was rabbit and deer but occasionally
antelope and mountain sheep supplemented their meager
fare, and any sort of smaller game was used when obtainable.
Hyrum Leany, who settled in Harrisburg in 1862, relates how
the Indians used to go hunting lizards and chipmunks (ta-bats
pa-shugi). The boys would tuck the heads under their belts and
sometimes would come home with a beltful. The chuckwalla
lizards were regarded as delicacies and the Indians had learned
the art of removing them from the crevices in which they puff
themselves up until their sides are pressed tightly against the rock,
thus making it difficult to dislodge them. By puncturing the distended
lungs with a sharp hooked stick, they were easily extracted.</p>
<p>To cook a small animal, such as rabbit or chipmunk, the
Paiutes laid it in the fire without any preliminary preparation
other than the removal of the skin, and the hot coals were raked
over it. All parts of the body were eaten and nothing edible was
missed. Surplus meat was usually dried.</p>
<p>Among the plants, grass seed was a staple article of diet. It
could be gathered in those days almost anywhere, though the
grass has largely disappeared since the advent of the white man&rsquo;s
horses, cattle and sheep. The fruit of the cactus (tuna or prickly
pear) furnished a food mainstay in midsummer. In places where
the yant (<i>Agave</i>) was found, the young flower stalks were roasted
barbecue fashion. This was a delicacy designated as pe-ya-ga-mint,
&ldquo;a sweet food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sugar was obtained in small quantities from the water willows
and from the reed cane (<i>Phragmites</i>) by cutting it when
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
plant lice had been working on it. As it dried, crystals of sugar
appeared. This was gathered by shaking off the crystals and
using them as a delicacy.</p>
<p>Among the native fruits gathered in season were the wild
grapes and the sour squawberries of the stream banks in the valleys,
the little red ookie berries of the semi-alkaline flats, the
weump berries (<i>Berberis fremonti</i>) of the foothills, the sarvis
berries (<i>Amelanchier</i>) of the lower mountain slopes and the choke
cherries (<i>Prunus</i>), strawberries, and raspberries (<i>Rubus</i>) of the
mountains. Pine nuts obtained from the cones of the pinyon pines
were a staple fall crop gathered in large quantities and kept for
later use.</p>
<p>It is certain that the Parrusits Indians raised crops by irrigation
before the whites appeared among them. Escalante, in 1776,
remarked only about corn and squash, but it is believed that they
also raised beans and probably melons. Their farms were located
on small flats where water could be easily diverted from spring
or stream. Farming implements were mainly sticks of various
kinds, usually of ash, about three feet long and three or four inches
wide toward one end, with the edges sharpened and running to a
point. Ditches were hard to make and maintain due to periodic
floods. Cultivated areas were usually very small, five acres
being the maximum.</p>
<p>An old Kaibabits Indian named George graphically described
the farming operations thus: &ldquo;Kaibab Injuns no raise&rsquo;m crops.
&rsquo;nudder Injuns raise&rsquo;m. No shovel, no hoe. Use&rsquo;m stick; dig&rsquo;m
ditch; make water come. Dig little hole over here, over there,
all around; plant&rsquo;um corn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squaws performed most of the labor in tending the crops.
The bucks were the warriors and hunters. Harvesting the corn,
carrying water, gathering grass seed, grinding corn meal, making
bread, making clothing, all were squaw&rsquo;s work. There may,
however, have been a more equal division of work than appears
to us now, since the food supply and safety of the home depended
much upon the prowess of the hunter and the vigilance of the
warrior.</p>
<p>The simple personal equipment and belongings gathered up
by an individual during his lifetime were usually buried with him
for his spirit journey. Nothing of material value was passed on
from generation to generation; each had to depend upon his own
efforts. Weaklings, cripples, and the aged had a hard time. If
they became burdensome, they were usually abandoned and sometimes
burned. St. George cattlemen at Mount Trumbull frustrated
an attempted burning as late as the nineties. The Uinkarets
had just left camp when the cowboys accidentally stumbled upon
it. One wickiup was left standing. The doorway had been fastened,
wood and trash had been piled around it and set on fire as
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
the Indians left. Inside, an old blind Indian named Waterman
was nearly suffocated when the cowboys released him. The Indians
having abandoned him refused to care for him further and
he became a burden on the whites.</p>
<p>At the time of the white settlement of the Virgin River Valley
in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, there were perhaps a thousand Parrusits in
various bands along the stream with their principal camping
places near Rockville, Virgin City, Toquerville, Washington
Fields and Santa Clara. These all appear to have recognized
the leadership of Chief Tut-se-gavits, head of the Tonaquint band
living on the Santa Clara Creek, and to have been held together
under regular tribal control.</p>
<p>G. H. Heap, one of the Argonauts, described the Paiutes in
1853 in the following uncomplimentary paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pah-Utah Indians are the greatest horse
thieves on the continent. Rarely attempting the bold
coup-de-main of the Utahs, they dog travelers during
their march and follow on their trail like jackals, cutting
off any stragglers whom they can surprise and overpower,
and pick up such animals as stray from the band
or lag behind from fatigue. At night lurking around
the camp, and concealing themselves behind rocks and
bushes, they communicate with each other by imitating
the sounds of birds and animals. They never ride, but
use as food the horses and mules that they steal, and,
if within arrowshot of one of these animals, a poisoned
shaft secures him as their prize. Their arms are bows
and arrows tipped with obsidian, and lances sometimes
pointed with iron, which they obtain from the wrecks of
wagons found along the road. They also use a pronged
stick to drag lizards from their holes.</p>
<p>Yearly expeditions are fitted out in New Mexico
to trade with the Pah-Utahs for their children and recourse
is often had to foul means to force their parents
to part with them. So common is it to make a raid for
this purpose, that it is considered as no more objectionable
than to go on a buffalo or a mustang hunt. One of
our men, Jose Galliego [<i>sic</i>], who was an old hand at
this species of man-hunting, related to us with evident
gusto, numerous anecdotes on this subject; and as we
approached the village he rode up to Mr. Beale and
eagerly proposed to him that we should &ldquo;charge on it
like h&mdash;l, kill the mans, and maybe catch some of the
little boys and gals.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>The coming of the Mormon pioneers gradually upset the
Paiute government. The whites frequently settled on Indian
camp sites and occupied Indian farming lands. Their domestic
livestock ate the grass that formerly supplied the Indians with
seed, and crowded out deer and other game upon which they
largely subsisted. This interference with their movements and
the reduction in the food supply tended eventually to bring the
Indians into partial dependence upon the whites.</p>
<p>Within a few years, farm crops and livestock brought to the
whites more food and clothing than the Indians had ever dreamed
of. No wonder they became beggars in the towns and thieves of
cattle and horses on the range. As long as the whites were in
the minority, they used to feed the Indians. In the words of John
Dennett, an old settler of Rockville, this &ldquo;gave them an idea of
some other kind of food beside grass seed and wild game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the whites increased and became strong enough to defy
the Indians, the attitude changed from one of fear to that of domination.
Although they continued more or less to feed the begging
Indians, they soon put a stop to thievery on the range, punishing
it in many cases by death. This transition was marked by bitter
feeling and even by war between the races. In time, it became
increasingly difficult for the Indians to maintain themselves.</p>
<p>Not only was their food supply reduced, but the whites also
spread strange maladies among the Indians. Measles and smallpox
are known to have been fatal in many cases. When Silver
Reef, a mining town of 1500 people, was flourishing in the 70&rsquo;s
and 80&rsquo;s it is known that venereal diseases were spread among
the Indians. Fatalities from disease and the diminution of food
supplies were undoubtedly heavy factors in the drastic reduction
of the Indian population. Of the estimated thousand Parrusits
living along the Virgin River in the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, there was only
one survivor (until his death in June, 1945), an old fellow called
Peter Harrison, who lived among the Shivwits Indians on the Santa
Clara reservation.</p>
<p>Among the neighbors of the Parrusits there remained in 1933
only about seventy-five Kaibabits on a reservation at Moccasin,
Arizona, some fifty Shivwits on a reservation on the Santa Clara
Creek, fifty miles to the west; and about fifty Com-o-its in the
vicinity of Cedar City. The Uinkarets and several smaller
groups are today entirely extinct.</p>
<p>Asked to account for this tragedy, the old Kaibabits Indian
George explained it this way: &ldquo;When white man come, lotsa
Injuns here; alla same white man now. Injuns heap yai-quay
[meaning lots of them die]; maybe so six, maybe so five, maybe
so two in night. Purty soon all gone. White man, he come:
raise&rsquo;m pompoose. Purty soon lotsa white man.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Early Explorations</span></h2>
<p>Zion Canyon was known to the Indians from time immemorial,
but its discovery by white men, so far as is known, dates only from
the middle of the 19th century. However, the series of explorations
in this region which finally led to its discovery cover the period
of three quarters of a century beginning in 1776.</p>
<p>In that year a party of Spaniards passed through the region
and crossed the Virgin River within twenty miles of Zion Canyon
without knowing of its proximity. This was the remarkable expedition
led by Fathers Dominguez and Escalante through portions
of New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Arizona. The object
of the expedition was two-fold. The Spanish government desired
a direct route from Santa Fe, New Mexico, to the Presidio of Monterey,
California, and the priests themselves had dreams of founding
new Indian missions in the unexplored territory beyond the
Colorado River. The governor of New Mexico furnished provisions,
Father Dominguez provided the horses and mules and Father
Silvestre Velez de Escalante was the diarist of the party.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The expedition set out July 29, 1776 from Santa Fe, passing
through explored territory as far as the Gunnison river in southwestern
Colorado, whence it struck out into the unknown. The
priests were fortunate in finding a couple of young Ute Indians
from Utah Lake, who acted as guides and who led them safely
across the Colorado (Grand) and Green Rivers up the Duchesne
to its headwaters and across the Wasatch Range to their home on
Utah Lake.</p>
<p>Obtaining fresh guides, the party proceeded about two hundred
miles into the deserts of southwestern Utah to Black Rock
Springs near Milford, heading for the Pacific coast. They had
been longer than expected on their journeyings. Fall was rapidly
advancing. A snowfall on October 5 dashed their hopes of being
able to cross the great Sierras still blocking their path to Monterey.
Provisions were getting low and they were a long way from
either Monterey or Santa Fe. Casting of lots determined that they
should go back home.</p>
<p>Instead of retracing their circuitous route, they determined to
take a short cut. They turned southeast, coming out of the desert
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
that now bears Escalante&rsquo;s name, a few miles west of Cedar City.
The high mountains to the east forced them southward nearly a
hundred miles along the foot of the rough and rugged escarpment
known as the Hurricane Fault. This deflected them far from their
intended course.</p>
<p>It was on this detour that they discovered the Virgin River
and came closest to Zion Canyon. The party left the vicinity of
Cedar City, crossed over the rim of the Great Basin at Kanarra and
descended Ash Creek, tributary of the Virgin. A short distance
below Toquerville they passed the three Indian cornfields with
well made irrigation ditches, to which reference has already been
made, and reached the Virgin River at the point where Ash Creek
and La Verkin Creek joined it. Escalante called Ash Creek the
Rio del Pilar. The main stream of the Virgin River above this
point he named the Sulphur River because of the hot sulphur
springs that flow into the stream about a mile distant from the
point where the great Hurricane Fault crosses the river.</p>
<p>The party climbed out of the canyon alongside a volcanic
ash cone or crater standing north of the present town of Hurricane.
While some of the members of the party probably lingered to investigate
the hot sulphur springs, others went ahead across the
Hurricane bench and striking some Indian tracks, followed them
out of the proper route and found themselves in the midst of an
area of red sand dunes several miles in extent, sometimes called
the Red Desert. This may be seen from the road approaching Zion
from either St. George or Cedar City.</p>
<p>The sand dunes made traveling very difficult and by the
time the party had plowed its way through and stood on top of a
high bluff overlooking the corrugated valley below, both the horses
and men were so tired they could scarcely make their way down
the bluff to water at the site of old Fort Pearce. Here they found a
desert shrub, the creosote bush (<i>Hediondilla</i>) and tamarisk trees
(supposed to have been introduced from the old world).</p>
<p>Here their provisions became exhausted, and from then on
they had to subsist largely upon horse flesh and such food as they
could procure from the Indians. The next morning, as they started
on their journey, they met a group of the Parrusits Indians who
were living in scattered bands along the Upper Virgin River, forming
one of the dozen or more clans belonging to the Paiute tribe,
and who warned them that they were headed toward the Grand
Canyon at a place where it could not be forded. After much persuasion
they agreed to show the explorers a route by which they
could climb the Hurricane Fault and proceed eastward toward a
ford of the Colorado.</p>
<p>The Indians led them four or five miles up a narrow canyon
along a footpath that became so steep and ledgy that the horses
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
and mules could not follow. Perceiving this, the Indians fled and
the party was forced to retrace the rocky trail to the foot and press
southward again, crossing the present line into Arizona. They became
suspicious that the Indians were purposely misdirecting
them.</p>
<p>That night they made a dry camp, and having neither food
nor water, both men and animals suffered intensely. Early next day
they found water but after traveling about twenty-five miles some
of the men were so weak and hungry they had to stop to rest.
After ransacking their camp outfit, they found odds and ends
enough to satisfy their worst needs.</p>
<p>At this point they found a way to climb the bold face of the
Hurricane Fault. Hungry and thirsty, they headed for rough
country to the southeast where they found water after about eighteen
miles. They also found Indians from whom they procured
some food. Again being warned by the Indians of the great impassable
Grand Canyon ahead they swung off sharply to the northeast.</p>
<p>Continuing the journey, guided only by the vague directions
given by the Indians, the party spent several days during late October
and early November in crossing the Arizona Strip and southern
Utah before they found a ford of the Colorado, a few miles
upstream on the Utah side of the state line, since known as the
&ldquo;Crossing of the Fathers.&rdquo; The hardships of the party in traversing
Northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico to get
back to Santa Fe, however, are not a part of this story.</p>
<p>The journey lasted from July 29, 1776 to January 2, 1777. It
covered a circuitous route through four states and the priests had
been pathbreakers in new and unexplored territory. One objective,
the route to the Pacific coast, had not been attained, but the
other, that of locating sites for missions, had been abundantly fulfilled.
Many possibilities were marked along the route, but apparently
none gave the Fathers more satisfaction than the prospects
among the Parrusits Indians on the Pilar River (now Ash
Creek and Virgin River) who were already farmers.</p>
<p>On finding the cornfield and irrigation ditches of the Parrusits,
Escalante remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By this we were greatly rejoiced, now because of the
hope it gave of being able to take advantage of certain
supplies in the future; especially because it was an indication
of the application of these people to the cultivation of
the soil; and because we found this much done toward reducing
them to civilized life and to the faith when the
Most High may so dispose, for it is well known how much
it costs to bring other Indians to this point, and how difficult
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
it is to convert them to this labor which is so necessary
to enable them to live for the most part in civilized
life and in towns.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Spanish Fathers never fulfilled their dreams of missions
beyond the Colorado, but they explored an uncharted area, into
which other Spaniards followed. The records, however, are meager
and information incomplete about these later expeditions. Two
other Spaniards, Mestes in 1805 and Arze and Garcia in 1812-13,
seem to have penetrated as far as Utah Lake and perhaps southward,
but so far as is known, their trips had little significance.<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Still later, other Spaniards developed the route from Santa
Fe to the Pacific coast which the Fathers had failed to do. Known
as the Old Spanish Trail, this passed northwestward from Santa
Fe through southwestern Colorado and central Utah and then
southwestward to Los Angeles. It crossed Escalante&rsquo;s trail near
Cedar City. But before this route was developed, other explorers
had opened the way.</p>
<p>After Dominguez and Escalante, the next pathbreaker of importance
to enter the region was Jedediah Strong Smith, a trapper
and trader bent on expanding his fur business. He was probably
the first to finish the task started by Escalante, that of finding a
route to the coast, which he traversed in 1826 and again in 1827.
Smith&rsquo;s epochal explorations, like Escalante&rsquo;s a half-century
earlier, were circuitous in nature and his first trip covered an area
now embraced by four states, Utah, Arizona, Nevada and California.
The eastern side of his loop overlapped the western side
of Escalante&rsquo;s and probably their trails coincided for short distances
where they crossed.</p>
<p>Smith belonged to the firm of Smith, Jackson and Sublette,
which had purchased General Ashley&rsquo;s fur interests and was trapping
through the region southward from Montana through Idaho
and Wyoming to northern Utah. The summer camp or rendezvous
of the firm was at Bear Lake near the Utah-Idaho line and
most of the trapping grounds were to the north and east. Knowing
nothing about the region lying south and west of the Great
Salt Lake, Smith fitted out a party of about sixteen men to explore
and trap the unknown region.</p>
<p>He left the shores of the Great Salt Lake, August 22, 1826,
and proceeded south and west to Los Angeles, arriving there late
in November. His exact course through Utah was long a matter
of controversy<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> but with the discovery, by Maurice Sullivan, of
an additional letter<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a> written by Smith, the controversy was
settled. It now seems certain that he followed the route proposed
by the author to Maurice Sullivan (ibid.) from Utah Lake Southward
to Sevier River in the vicinity of Fayette, followed it up to
the mouth of Marysvale Canyon, and mistaking Clear Creek for
the head of the river (evidently not recognizing the stream
coming through Marysvile Canyon), passed over the divide at
the head of Clear Creek and down by Cove Fort, south along the
west foot of the mountains to Beaver River (which he called
Lost River), on past the present site of Cedar City to the rim
of the Great Basin, thence to Ash Creek along the route Escalante
had taken to the Virgin River, down the Virgin to the Colorado
River and across the Mojave Desert to the Coast.</p>

<p>Smith called the Virgin the Adams River in compliment to
President John Quincy Adams, although it was in territory then
claimed by Mexico. At the mouth of Santa Clara Creek, he fell in
with a group of Paiute Indians (his printed word is Pa Ulches,
probably a misprint for Pa Utches), who wore rabbit skin robes and
raised a little corn and pumpkins. He called the Santa Clara, Corn
Creek.</p>
<p>On his first trip of 1826, he followed the Virgin River down
through the narrows below the mouth of the Santa Clara, a hazardous
undertaking since most of the channel is barely wide enough
to accommodate the stream. This would have involved much wading
of the stream over shifting quicksand, through deep holes and
around giant rocks and boulders. On his second trip, a year later, he
avoided these narrows by going up Corn Creek (Santa Clara)
about twenty five miles, crossing over a pass to the drainage into
Beaver Dam Wash which he followed down to the Virgin, rejoining
his old route about ten miles below the narrows.<a class="fn" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>These pioneering trips of Smith&rsquo;s not only opened two new
routes to the Pacific, westward and southwestward, but his reports
of his travels and stories of adventure undoubtedly incited others
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
to follow. One of these was George C. Yount, who was
in the mountains with Smith for several months. Smith&rsquo;s stories
inflamed in him a desire to visit California. In the fall of 1830,
Yount joined a party organized by William Wolfskill at Santa Fe
for the purpose of reaching the coast. Coming up through the
corner of Colorado and eastern Utah, they reached the Sevier
River, probably through Salina Canyon, arrived at the Virgin River
and followed it down to the Colorado. The story of this trip was
told by Yount in his old age and the details of the route are not
precise, but it appears that his party must have attempted to follow
Smith&rsquo;s trail.<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> It is probable that these explorations had a
great deal to do with the development of the Old Spanish Trail,
then in its formative stages.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Subsequently, the Old Spanish Trail became a regular overland
route, following the Sevier River nearly to Panguitch, then
over the Bear Valley pass to Paragonah, across the desert to the
Mountain Meadows, down the Santa Clara past Gunlock, over
the divide to Beaver Dam Wash, paralleling the Virgin River,
across desert hills to the Muddy River and thence across toward
Los Angeles via Las Vegas.</p>
<p>By 1844, when Captain John C. Fremont of the U. S. Army
came over the route from the coast to Paragonah, this was a well
defined trail, over which annual caravans traveled back and forth
from Santa Fe to the coast.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> Untold numbers of Spaniards may
have traveled the route that Escalante had tried vainly to find, leaving
their impress along the way in the Spanish names given to many
of the important places, several of which have persisted to this day.
The names, Rio Virgen (River of Virgins), Santa Clara Creek
and La Verkin Creek, all probably originated with the Spaniards,
between the time of Jedediah S. Smith and John C. Fremont.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Fremont followed the route from the coast past Las Vegas
and encamped on the Muddy River after a fifty to sixty mile jaunt
across the parched desert, sixteen hours of uninterrupted traveling
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
without water. The Indians were numerous and insulting, evidently
intent upon raiding the camp and stealing anything they
could. Horses fatigued and left behind the night before were
found butchered the next morning. The party remained in camp
all day on May 5, 1844, to let their animals recuperate from the
hard trip of the day before. They remained constantly armed and
on watch. Fremont called the natives Digger Indians. They fed
largely upon lizards and other small animals of the desert. Many
of them carried long sticks, hooked at the end for extracting lizards
from the rocks.</p>
<p>As Fremont traveled up the Virgin River, the Indians followed
stealthily in the rear and quickly cut off any animals that
were left behind. While encamped near the present site of Littlefield,
Arizona, one of the men, Tabeau, was killed by the Indians
when he went back alone a short distance to look for a lost mule.
The party that went in search of him found where he had been
dragged by the Indians to the edge of the river and thrown in. His
horse, saddle, clothing, arms, and the mule had all been taken by
the Indians.</p>
<p>The two thousand-foot mountain gorge above Littlefield
forced Fremont to leave the Virgin and turn off to the north where
he regained the Old Spanish Trail which he had lost in the sands
of the desert. Surmounting a pass, he reached the Santa Clara
and followed it up to the Mountain Meadows where, he states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found an extensive mountain meadow, rich
in bunch grass, and fresh with numerous springs of clear
water, all refreshing and delightful to look upon. It was,
in fact, that las Vegas de Santa Clara, which had been
so long represented to us as the terminating point of the
desert, and where the annual caravan from California to
New Mexico halted and recruited for some weeks. It
was a very suitable place to recover from the fatigue and
exhaustion of a month&rsquo;s suffering in the hot and sterile
desert. The meadow was about a mile wide and some
ten miles long, bordered by grassy hills and mountains....
In passing before the great caravan, we had the advantage
of finding more grass, but the disadvantage of
finding also the marauding savages, who had gathered
down upon the trail, waiting the approach of their prey....
At this place we had complete relief from the heat
and privations of the desert and some relaxation from the
severity of camp duty.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After a day of rest (May 13) at the Meadows, Fremont
pushed to the northeast across the south end of the Great Basin
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
until he reached the Little Salt Lake near Paragonah. Here he left
the Old Spanish Trail and cut off to the north along the edge of
the desert at the western foot of the mountains. On May 20 he
met a band of Ute Indians under the leadership of the well known
chief, Walker (Wah-kerr), journeying southward to levy the annual
toll upon the California caravan. Fremont says, &ldquo;They were
all mounted, armed with rifles, and use their rifles well.... They
were robbers of a higher order than those of the desert. They
conducted their depredations with form and under the color of
trade and toll for passing through their country. Instead of attacking
and killing, they affect to purchase, taking the horses they
like and giving something nominal in return.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Early Mormon Settlement</span></h2>
<p>While trade between California and New Mexico was beating
the path of the Old Spanish Trail into a road across southwestern
Utah, events elsewhere were leading to the elimination of
Spanish influence and the rise of Anglo-Saxon power. The Mexican
War ended Spanish domination, but it was the Mormon migrations
which were to fill the region with settlements.</p>
<p>In 1847, the Mormons began to move west from the Missouri
River to the Great Salt Lake Valley. The precedent of Texas
breaking away from Mexico was before them as they traveled
across the plains to enter Mexican territory, where they would
be free from those who had persecuted them, and where they
would be practically isolated from Mexican authority by the barrier
of the Grand Canyon. What dreams of empire held their
thoughts as they trekked across the plains can only be conjectured.<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Outposts, forts, and settlements were scattered throughout
the vast area they hoped to dominate. Western Colorado, southwestern
Wyoming, southern Idaho, Utah, Nevada, northern Arizona
and southern California were all included in their colonization
plans. Strategic points throughout this whole vast empire
were to be occupied and controlled. The intervening territory
would be filled in later with the great number of converts to the
faith pouring in from Europe. The transfer of this entire territory
to the United States by the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo
exercised a restraining influence upon their ambitions and brought
them once more under the hand of the Federal government.</p>
<p>During the first few years of settlement, there was little
change in governmental organization and the people were for the
most part guided and controlled by their religious leaders. In
March, 1849, they set up a provisional government for their proposed
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
State of Deseret.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a> In 1851, however, Congress carved this
western empire into territories, paying no attention to the proposed
State and designating its heart as the Territory of Utah
(named for the dominant Indian nation of the region, the Utes or
Utahs). The Mormon dreams were thus dimmed, but they did
not finally die until 1858, when Albert Sydney Johnston&rsquo;s army
marched to Utah and completely ended all hopes of an independent
political unit. Thereafter, the Mormon attitude gradually
changed from one of open opposition to one of conditioned
loyalty and the long struggle for statehood began.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>It was during the period of expansion and occupation that
southwestern Utah was generally explored with a view toward
settlement. Late in the fall of 1847, a small party under the leadership
of Captain Jefferson Hunt pushed to the Pacific coast to secure
provisions and livestock, carrying instructions to the
Mormon Battalion members mustered out in California to remain
there that winter and not to attempt to come to Salt Lake until
Spring.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a> The party followed approximately the route of U. S.
Highway 91 from Great Salt Lake to Little Salt Lake, Iron
County, where it picked up the Old Spanish Trail and followed
it to the coast. Hunt&rsquo;s men were the first Mormons to travel the
route later known as the Mormon Trail. Where they obtained
information to guide them is a question, but it is known that the
Mormons were acquainted with Fremont&rsquo;s report of his trip along
that route in 1844. There was an important deviation from Fremont&rsquo;s
path, however; they went through Scipio Valley and the
pass to the east of the Canyon range of mountains, whereas Fremont
had gone on the west side. Further details of this trip are
lacking.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>The party wintered in California, where negotiations were
entered into between Hunt and United States Army officers for
raising another battalion of Mormons to garrison posts in California.
When Hunt returned to Salt Lake in the spring of 1848,
he carried the details with him, but no report of his trip is extant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>On September 17, 1848, while Brigham Young was visiting at
Fort Provo, a group of leaders gathered at Hunt&rsquo;s house in the
evening to &ldquo;converse about the southern country and the prospects
of settling it.... Many questions were asked in regard to
routes, traveling, locations, incidents, etc., and the prospects before
the Saints caused quite a good feeling.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></p>
<p>During the late summer and fall of 1849, hundreds of emigrants
on their way to seek gold in California poured into the
Salt Lake Valley too late to make the trip westward across the
Sierra Nevada Mountains before snow blocked the way. There
was little food and the Mormons were not eager to have these
people winter with them. The difficulty was solved by the offer
of Captain Hunt to pilot them across the southern route.</p>
<p>Altogether there were about 125 wagons and 1,000 head of
cattle. The Argonauts were a nondescript lot, everyone intent
upon his own personal problems and not actuated by a common
ideal as were the Mormons. They caused Hunt a great deal of
trouble and even threatened his life over certain details of the
trip. Dissensions arose which split the party several times. At
last, near the rim of the Great Basin not far from the Mountain
Meadows, most of them left him for a supposed cutoff via Walker&rsquo;s
Pass in the Sierras. Hunt, in peace, safely piloted the
remaining six or seven wagons to the coast. The party taking
the cutoff ended in disaster in Death Valley.<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a> Captain Hunt
stayed in California more than a year and returned to Utah early
in 1851.</p>
<p>In December, 1849, the General Assembly of the provisional
State of Deseret commissioned a company already organized
under the leadership of Parley P. Pratt, to explore the south and
ascertain its possibilities for sustaining settlements.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a> The expedition
of nearly fifty men had left on November 25. They pushed
south during the cold weather via the new settlement of Manti.
Following the Sevier River to Circleville Canyon, they turned
up a defile to the southwest and followed it about twelve miles
north of the Spanish Trail over the mountains into the Little Salt
Lake Valley, December 21. Two days later they camped on
Red Creek (now Paragonah) where they paused to recuperate
among the excellent meadows, willows and bunch grass abounding
there at that time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Here it was decided to divide the party, some to guard the
recuperating cattle, while twenty of the men with horses and
mules were to push the exploration southward. Those who remained
moved their camp to Birch Creek (now Parowan) and
while waiting explored the surrounding region. Some went up
Parowan Canyon where they discovered accessible timber, plaster
of paris (gypsum), water lime (limestone) and iron ore.</p>
<p>Between Jan. 2 and 6, 1850, a company of ten men explored
west of Little Salt Lake, where they found many Indian pictographs
on the rocks. A few miles west of the present site of Cedar City
they came upon a &ldquo;range of hills filled with iron ore of the richest
quality&mdash;probably 75 per cent.&rdquo; Four Indians visited them and
when told that the explorers were Mormons, they said ... &ldquo;Captain
Walker had told them about us, that we were his friends.
They said they were our friends and would not kill our cattle or
horses. Walker told them the Mormons raised Shaunt Tickup
[lots of food] and they wanted us to come and raise it among them.
They said they loved the Mormons. They are very poor and have
no horses or skins. They live upon rabbits which are plenty in
their valley (now Cedar Valley) and clothe themselves with their
skins.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a> This party of ten rejoined the camp on January 6.</p>
<p>An exploring party of twenty went south on December 26,
reached the rim of the Great Basin at the present site of Kanarra
two days later, and then descended Ash Creek, as had Escalante
in 1776 and Jedediah Smith in 1826 and 1827. They crossed the
black volcanic ridge, probably camping in the vicinity of Pintura.
On December 31, 1849, Pratt summarized his impressions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the Basin Rim 13 miles of rapid descent brought
us to milder climate and first cultivation [Indian]. A mile
or so farther brought us to the banks of the Virgin.</p>
<p>The great Wasatch range along which we had traveled
our whole journey here terminates in several abrupt
promontories [Kolob, La Verkin and Zion]. The country
southward for 80 miles showing so signs of water or fertility;
... a wide expanse of chaotic matter presented itself,
huge hills, sandy deserts, cheerless, grassless plains, perpendicular
rocks, loose barren clay, dissolving beds of
sandstone ... lying in inconceivable confusion&mdash;....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>January 1, 1850, they continued down the fertile valleys of the
Virgin River as far the Santa Clara Creek. Pratt says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bottoms now expanded about one mile in width
and several miles in length, loose sandy soil, very pleasant
for farming, extremely fertile and easily watered and
sometimes subject to overflow. No timber in the country
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
except large cottonwoods along the stream, sufficient for
temporary building and fuel....</p>
<p>The country below [to the southwest, where the
river cuts through a range of mountains] being of the most
unpromising character ... and our animals almost unable
to travel, ... it was thought imprudent to venture farther.
We therefore turned to the north up the Santa Clara....
The Indians were ... well armed with bows and poison
arrows and nearly equalling us in numbers. We fed them,
sung for them.... The chief made us a speech, bidding us
welcome to his country.... He strongly urged our people
to settle with them and raise &ldquo;tickup&rdquo; [food]. They
returned again next morning, piloted us all day. We saw
no appearance of women or children among them. They
cultivate small patches only, raise good crops by irrigation.
We gave them peas for seed, presents of dried meat....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following up the Santa Clara, they reached the new wagon
road made by Captain Jefferson Hunt and followed it over the
divide into the Great Basin, via the Mountain Meadows. Continuing
on the Old Spanish Trail eastward, they also discovered the iron
ore in the range of hills that the smaller party of ten had found a
day or two previously.</p>
<p>Back at the base camp after they arrived, preparations were
made for a big celebration on January 8, 1850. Pratt further reported
that a liberty pole was erected, and a flag marked with &ldquo;one star
and a great basin was hoisted together with a free soil banner.&rdquo;
A dinner was prepared and &ldquo;all sat down to a most substantial
public dinner, being the first celebration of the Peopling of Little
Salt Lake Valley, which we hope will be celebrated annually around
that Spot, &rsquo;till a hundred thousand merry hearts can join in the
festival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trip home was a hard one. They followed the west base of
the mountains, crossing Beaver Creek (Smith&rsquo;s Lost River),
where they camped on the night of January 12. It continued to
snow so hard that by the time they reached Rock Creek (now
Fillmore), they decided (January 20) to winter there. Several,
however, pushed on home, arriving about the end of the month.</p>
<p>The information thus brought to Mormon headquarters was
encouraging and the early settlement of southern Utah was decided
upon. The report of finding large quantities of iron ore
west of the present site of Cedar City aroused considerable interest.
During the summer of 1850 plans were laid for colonizing
the newly created Iron County, the seat to be located at Center
Creek, later called Parowan. After harvest in 1850, colonists
were called by the Mormon leaders to settle that region. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
&ldquo;call&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> in this case was published in the <i>Deseret News</i> of November
16, 1850, and was a request for those listed to meet at Fort
Provo as soon as possible to organize the expedition.</p>
<p>The group formed in mid-December under the leadership of
George A. Smith and traveled south for nearly a month during
the cold of late December and early January over a wretched
road, in many places covered with snow. The leaders arrived
at Center Creek on January 13, 1851, and immediately set out to
explore the surrounding country. The next day one party explored
Parowan Canyon, another party went up Summit Creek
Canyon, a third re-explored the Little Salt Lake, a fourth went
up Red Creek, while George A. Smith and more than twenty
others went on southwestward to the region around Cedar Valley
and Iron Springs.</p>
<p>On the way they met Captain Jefferson Hunt returning from
California, and invited him to remain with them while his party
went on to Center Creek. Around the camp fire on the night of
January 15, they discussed the organization of a local government,
appointed a committee to nominate the officers needed
and decided to hold an election on January 17. Convinced that
Center Creek was the proper place to establish their settlement,
they held the election there as scheduled, and a pioneer celebration
was staged.</p>
<p>John D. Lee describes this event as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At 10 oclock [a.m.], Thomas S. Smith, one of the
judges of election cried three times in an audible voice,
declaring that the polls were open and ready to receive
votes.... At 3 o&rsquo;clock [p.m.], at the sound of the
trumpet, the people assembled around the public dinner,
each man and his lady (that is those who had any) in
their respective places as follows: The judge was placed
at the head, then the gentlemen were seated on his left
according to their rank and the ladies on his right facing
their partners. Previous to sitting down, President
George A. Smith, delivered an oration suitable to
the circumstances of the citizens of Iron County in
celebrating the day on which law and order was first
established in that part of Utah. All the citizens of
Iron County then sat down upon the ground around the
public dinner spread upon buffalo robes; these were
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
placed next to the ground with clean and white table
cloths on top upon which were spread a variety of the
refreshments of life.... At 6 o&rsquo;clock the polls were
closed.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jefferson Hunt was elected representative. On January 18,
after four days &ldquo;residence&rdquo; in Iron County, he went on with
his party toward Great Salt Lake with his credentials in his
pocket.</p>
<p>The settlers immediately set to work building a combined
town and fort, making roads to the mountains for timber, clearing
land for cultivation, digging irrigation ditches, setting up
workshops and mills. On April 10-12, 1851, Parley P. Pratt, on
his way to the Pacific Coast, passed through the settlement and
found it in a flourishing condition.</p>
<p>By May, coal had been discovered in Cedar Canyon and its
value in blacksmithing demonstrated. In the fall, after crops
were harvested, a group of settlers moved from Parowan to the
present site of Cedar City. The discovery of good coal deposits
within a few miles of the iron ore aroused much interest
among the Mormon leaders. The prospects for the development
of an iron industry invited steps looking toward this. The
word was dispatched to their representatives in Europe. Apostles
Erastus Snow and Franklin D. Richards, then on missions in
England, who organized the Deseret Iron Company in Liverpool
in the spring of 1852, for the development of the Utah deposits.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a>
Steel and iron workers as well as coal miners among the English
converts were encouraged to migrate to Utah to help in the iron
industry. Snow and Richards returned to Salt Lake City in
August, and in November, Snow went south to arrange matters
on the spot. By the spring of 1852, two foundries were in operation.</p>
<p>E. H. Beale and G. H. Heap, California bound, passed
through the settlements, August 2-4, 1853. Heap gives a vivid
picture of that early life.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a> His party came by the Sevier River
over the Old Spanish Trail to Paragonah, Parowan and Cedar
City on its way to the coast. Paragonah had thirty adobe houses
arranged in the form of a quadrangle to form a fort. Outside the
fort was an area of fifty acres enclosed by a single fence and
cultivated in common by the inhabitants, a practice soon discontinued
when the lands were divided into individual farms. The
Indian War under Chief Walker, which had broken out in July
1853, farther north, had spread southward. Walker and his
band had been harassing outlying settlements and stealing cattle
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
and horses. Brigham Young sent one hundred and fifty men
into action against him, declared martial law and ordered the
people to concentrate in large communities. This order came to
Paragonah while Heap was there. He says the inhabitants
quickly began to move. Houses were demolished, windows,
doors and furniture loaded into wagons, and they were soon on
the road to Parowan.</p>
<p>Parowan was similarly organized but was much larger, having
a hundred houses and a four hundred-acre field outside the
fort. In describing Cedar City, Heap states that it was a place of
even greater importance than Parowan, having extensive fields
outside the fort abundantly irrigated. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The inhabitants are principally foreigners, and
mostly Englishmen from the coal districts of Great
Britain. At the time of our visit, the place was crowded
with the people of the surrounding country seeking
refuge from the Indians, and its square was blocked up
with wagons, furniture, tents, farming implements, etc.,
in the midst of which were men, women and children,
together with every description of cattle, creating a
scene of confusion difficult to describe.... Mounted
men, well armed, patrolled the country, and expresses
came in from different quarters, bringing accounts of attacks
by Indians on small parties and unprotected farms
and houses. In face of these reports, Walker sent a
message to Colonel G. A. Smith, military commander at
Parowan, telling him that the &ldquo;Mormons were d&mdash;&mdash;
fools for abandoning houses and towns, for he did not
intend to molest them there, as it was his intention to
confine his depredation to their cattle, and that he advised
them to return and mind their crops, for if they
neglected them, they would starve and be obliged to
leave the country, which was not what he desired, for
then there would be no cattle for him to take.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Indian war subsided in the spring of 1854 and the
people were again free to attend to farming and mining, although,
as a matter of fact, they maintained the military organization
for many years thereafter, as long as the Indian menace persisted.</p>
<p>Despite their precaution in maintaining a military organization,
the Mormons actually preferred a policy of peaceful penetration
and directed positive efforts toward that end. They
sent missionaries among the Indians, established missions among
them, cultivated friendship with those around the settlements
and bestowed gifts and goods upon them. It was easier to penetrate
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
by feeding and friendship than by fighting; moreover, this
policy was in line with the teaching of the Book of Mormon that
the Indians (there called Lamanites) would be converted and
absorbed and would become &ldquo;a white and delightsome people.&rdquo;
This Mormon policy of keeping peace with the Indians smoothed
the course of settlement and improved opportunities for expansion.</p>
<p>At first the iron industry showed considerable promise, but
technical difficulties and the enormous cost of transportation
without railroad facilities prevented its expansion. Jules Remy, a
French observer who passed through the settlements in 1855,
states that the mines, both iron and coal, were being worked and
the foundries were turning out about a ton of pig iron per day.
This was obtained from ore yielding 25 to 75 per cent iron.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a> With
the development of railroads across northern Utah, bringing in
iron from elsewhere, the industry in the south languished. It had
served, however, to accelerate the settlement of this region, and
with its passing the pioneers turned to other occupations, especially
to agriculture and stockraising, the foundation of the frontier
communities.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">Pushing South into Dixie</span></h2>
<p>In the fall of 1851, a party pushed southward from Salt Lake
City under the leadership of John D. Lee with the intention of
settling on the Virgin or Santa Clara rivers. In this, they were
to be disappointed, for actual settlement had to wait upon a
preliminary period devoted to missions. Thereafter, during the
period of settlement, the Mormons were to maintain contact
with the Indians on their southern frontier through the agency
of missionaries who were to shoulder the lion&rsquo;s share of the
burden of advance exploration, keep in touch with Indian movements
and attitudes, designate routes of travel, report areas suitable
for agriculture and grazing and act as emissaries to the
Indians in times of trouble. This shift in policy is partly explained
in a letter from John D. Lee published in the Deseret News,
Saturday, April 3, 1852:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>On the 4th of Nov. I safely reached the city of
Parowan, without the loss of an animal or the break of
a wagon in the whole company. We then cheerfully
went to work with all our might to arrange our affairs
and situate our families in this city, that according to
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
counsel we might leave them comfortable, while we
would go and select a site and build a fort for our defense.
The brethren that joined our company in Iron
County sold out their improvements in full faith of helping
to form another settlement south of the waters of
the Santa Clara and Rio Virgin.</p>
<p>The severity of the weather and failure of the mill
caused a detention of three weeks. The most of our
wagons were loaded and ready for a start, when I
received a letter from Pres. B. Young, advising us to
tarry &rsquo;till another season, and thereby strengthen the
settlements already planted. The policy was doubtless
good, however revolting the disappointment may
have been to my feelings; and past experience admonished
me that to hearken was better than to sacrifice.</p>
<p>The Kanyons were now blockaded with snow and
ice, which rendered the pass to the timber and poles
difficult, if accessible at all for wagons. Under these
considerations, I felt justified to spend a few days in
exploring the country, believing that the time thus occupied,
would be more conducive to the spread of the
cause of Zion in the mountains, than to sit by the fireside,
reading, or otherwise passing off the time of an
inclement season.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chafing under this restraint, Lee determined to explore the
country regardless of Brigham Young&rsquo;s advice, and on January
27, 1852, led a party of twelve men,<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> with four wagons, thirteen
horses and fifteen days&rsquo; provisions, leaving Parowan for the
Virgin River region. He followed the route of the Southern
Exploring Expedition down Ash Creek but being burdened with
wagons had to be more careful in selecting the details of the
route. Near the present site of Pintura he left the wagons. Lee
further reports in his letter of that date that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... on foot and horseback [we] traveled down Ash
Creek over sand hills the distance of twelve miles which
brought us near its junction with the Levearskin River
[LaVerkin].... Being unable to cross this stream, we
ascended one of these mounds, from which we discovered
a stream running a SW direction which we supposed to
be the Rio Virgin; and from the shape of the country, we
concluded that we could take our wagons to it: Feb. 2d,
day, though in temperature more like May.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>To the Grapevine springs 5 miles; these springs
boil up at the foot of a large sand mound and moisten
about one acre of land, which is completely interlocked
with vines.... To the Rio Virgin River 5 miles, mostly
over yellow land; this stream is about 2 rods wide and
3 feet deep, narrow bottom, shut in on both sides with
low mountains.... [About 3 miles above Berry Springs.]</p>
<p>To the Otter creek 3 miles; stream 13 feet wide, 1
deep; abundance of otter and beaver along these
streams; as we descended this stream [the Virgin], the
bottom continued to widen out, and the amount of timber
increases affording land and other facilities sufficient
in many places, to warrant small settlements....
At the distance of 15 miles from camp we found ourselves
in one of the most pleasant, lovely valleys that
the mountains afford [Washington and Washington
Fields]. It is about 5 miles in diameter. The soil is of a
lively alluvial nature; and of a dark chocolate color,
and easily irrigated; banks of the stream low. The
climate is of a mild temperature; the sun here rises without
being hid behind the mountains so that its morning
and evening smiles are fully appreciated by the favored
vegetation of this valley.</p>
<p>Feb. 3d, the grapevines and cottonwood are almost
leaved out; the dock and other early herbs are in bloom....
This valley lies rolling to the south with occasional
springs of pure water breaking out at the distance of
from 1&frac12; to 1 mile from the river, converting that portion
of the valley into a rich meadow and vineyard....</p>
<p>Two miles over a small range of mountains brought
us in full view of the Santa Clara country and valley.
This valley is about the same magnitude as the one
already described: ... beautiful springs, grapevines and
meadows not excepted.</p>
<p>The Santa Clara river is 1 rod wide and 20 inches
deep, pure, clear water, rich bottoms, though narrow,
and heavily timbered for the distance of 30 miles. On
this stream we saw about 100 acres of land that had been
cultivated by the Paiute Indians principally in corn and
squashes.... This tribe is numerous and have quite an
idea of husbandry. Through the day, we saw three
of the natives who appeared frightened and fled at our
approach. I called to them in their tongue and told
them that we were their friends and would not hurt
them; we gave them some bread, and told them to pilot
us to their peup-capitan [big chief]; but fearing that
six men might slay the nation, they took us some two
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
miles above their settlement where we met in council
with thirteen of their braves, who after an understanding
of our business, received us friendly and expressed
a desire to have us settle among them and be tue-gee-tickaboo,
that is, very friendly....</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the Virgin the six men went up the Santa Clara to the
California road and followed it down to the Virgin below the
Beaver Dam Mountains. Lee and two others tried to make their
way up the river to the mouth of the Santa Clara looking for a
short-cut, but were disappointed to find the river flowing through
a box canyon which Lee estimated at 4,000 feet in depth (in
reality about half that). The trip was a difficult one; it rained
incessantly for two days and they were often obliged to wade
the river waist deep and were three days without food. They
returned to Parowan on February 18. Writing to Brigham
Young, March 17, 1852, Lee says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am making ready to accompany you on your exploration
when you come along. I have been gathering
all the information that I could from the Spaniards and
Walker [Indian Chief], and have taken a map from
them.... Sometimes I think I am more anxious about
the formation of new settlements south. But when I was
there in the forepart of the month of February and saw
the trees putting forth their green foliage and the herbs
almost in bloom, the rich soil and abundant streams of
pure water, ... where we can raise cotton, flax, hemp,
grapes, figs, sweet potatoes, fruits of almost every kind
... I scarcely could content myself to stay ... &rsquo;till another
fall.<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In early June, 1852, the old Indian chief, Quinnarrah (Kanarra),
requested the Parowan leaders to go over to Panguitch
Lake to visit the Indians who had gathered there to the number
of a hundred. J. C. L. Smith, John Steele, John D. Lee and three
others made the trip, going eighteen miles up Parowan Canyon
to the top of the mountain and descending nine miles on the
other side. They met the Indians, explored the region around
the lake, and garnered much information about the country
farther east on the headwaters of the Sevier River, into which
the lake drained. This information excited their curiosity and
upon returning home from their three-day trip, they immediately
organized another party to cover the region to the east beyond
the mountains.<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>This party set out on June 12, 1852 and included the following:
J. C. L. Smith, John Steele, John D. Lee, John L. Smith, John
Dart, Solomon Chamberlain, Priddy Meeks and F. T. Whitney.
They went through Paragonah, up Little Creek Canyon (now
Bear Valley route) and down into Panguitch Valley which they
considered suitable for a settlement of fifty to one hundred families
who could engage in lumbering, as there was excellent timber in
the mountains nearby.</p>
<p>Two days&rsquo; travel up the Sevier River brought them to a place
on Mammoth Creek with abundant timber, grass and water,
suitable for a small settlement. From here they bent their course
southeast to Fox Creek (now Asa Creek), passed through Pleasant
Valley (Duck Creek), over a ridge into Strawberry Creek.
According to the report of this trip written by J. C. L. Smith and
John Steele, they proceeded</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... thence on to the mountains which lie low and level,
so that a team and wagon might be driven any place
unto the highest mountains which are entirely covered
with pine timber. [The mountains between Midway
and Duck Creek east of Cedar Mountain].</p>
<p>We traveled three days among this timber which
is of the best quality and clear of underbrush; we then
crossed again the divide and came into Skull Cap Valley
and creek [now Swains Creek], which is about 10 feet
wide and one deep; thence up that 8 or 10 miles, and
crossed another ridge to the south, and came to the
headwaters of the Levier Skin [<i>sic</i>] [now Long Valley
Canyon]; thence down the Levier Sking [<i>sic</i>] about 50
miles. [To upper end of Parunuweap Canyon].</p>
<p>There can be a good wagon road got from the
Sevier country to this point. There are plenty of hops,
and timber and handsome places for settlements in the
narrow but fertile bottom of the stream [undoubtedly
Long Valley].</p>
<p>We have now to leave the stream on account of
the driftwood and narrowness of the passage down
through, and take to the mountains [to the south over
Harris Mt. Pass]; here the chance for a wagon road
ended and after considerable difficulty and winding
around, we arrived upon the Virgin bottoms [now
Canebeds] within one day&rsquo;s ride of the Colorado. Here
a number of Indians came to us, who told us that Walker
had told them of us, and they seemed very much
pleased although somewhat afraid at first. Brother J.
D. Lee gave them a talk, which pleased them very much,
to think that we were not come to kill them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>These Indians are very smart, quick and active,
almost naked, with bright intellects. We then proceeded
along, followed by our friends, who would not
leave us; showed us all the curiosities they could think
of, amongst the rest, a weed that will quench the thirst
[Bottlestopper, <i>Eriogonum inflatum</i>].</p>
<p>This is a fine country covered with verdure, although
there are no streams at this point, but it has the
appearance of raining a good deal. We then got some
Indian guides, who brought us to the jerks of the Virgin,
Levier Skin [La Verkin] and Ash Creek [probably via
Hurricane] where we found a number of Indians raising
grain. Their corn was waist high; squashes, beans,
potatoes, etc., looked well. They had in cultivation
four or five acres; their wheat had got ripe and was out.
I looked around to see their tools, but could not see
the first tool, only their hands to dig the ditches, make
dams, or anything else. The Piute chief made us a
speech showing us their destitute situation, without
clothes or food. Brother Lee told them we would learn
them to work and raise breadstuff, make clothing, etc.,
at which they were well pleased, and wanted us to come
soon and make a settlement among them. This point is
some 30 miles above where Brother Lee intends to settle.
We then crossed over Ash Creek, took our old trail, and
soon arrived at Parowan being gone 12 days&mdash;having
traveled 336 miles.</p>

<p>Sometime during the fall of 1852, John D. Lee and several
others located on Ash Creek, about twenty-five miles south of
Cedar City, at a place they called Harmony (near U.S. Highway
91, a few miles north of Ash Creek bridge). John D. Lee wrote
to Brigham Young, March 6, 1853, describing the progress as
satisfactory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have built six houses for my family besides helping
on every other building in the fort.... In the month of
January, in company with Peter Schurtz, I rode over
to the Rio Virgen country (or Warm Valley as the Indians
call it); we found the climate mild and pleasant....
Brother Brigham, If it is not asking too much, please
drop me a few lines relative to your feelings of forming
settlements south, and the probable time of settling the
Warm Valley that I may be ready to meet your expectations....
Please make known thy will and with pleasure
I will try to obey it.<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a></p>

<p>At the October, 1853 conference in Salt Lake City, a group
of fifty families and missionaries under the leadership of Rufus
C. Allen (who had been trained in missionary work under Parley
P. Pratt in South America) were &ldquo;called&rdquo; to strengthen the
southern Utah Mission and labor among the Indians. The settlers
left immediately but the missionaries delayed until the next
spring.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the additional settlers had strengthened
Harmony and an Indian school had been established. When the
missionaries arrived, May 16, 1854, they found ten Indians in
the school.<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a> Brigham Young visited Harmony on May 19 and
while there inquired if a wagon road could be built to the Virgin
River. He was given a discouraging reply.</p>
<p>A few days later, a number of the missionaries under Allen,
pushed on to the south among the Virgin River Indians.<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a> On
June 5, they descended Ash Creek and encountered a group of
Indians near the present site of Toquerville. They made friends
with the Indian Chief Toquer (meaning black, probably from
the lava rocks) and bargained with him to send a runner to the
neighboring Indians to arrange for a meeting with them. They
moved on next day and met the other Indians at the present
site of the old Washington Fields on the south side of the river.</p>
<p>These Indians were in a surly mood and had hidden their
squaws and papooses; hence the Mormons were doubtful of their
reception. However, one of them hunted up a hidden papoose
and gave him a small pocket mirror which the child showed to
the squaws. The trinket so pleased them that they all came out
of hiding and quickly made friends with the whites.</p>
<p>The missionaries proceeded thence to the Santa Clara River
by way of a trail north of the present site of St. George. Here
they made friends with the Indians and laid the foundation for
the establishment of a mission. The remainder returned to headquarters
at Harmony, but Jacob Hamblin and William Henefer
remained for some time on the Santa Clara working with the
Indians and visiting others farther upstream. They did not
reach Harmony until July.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>On June 21, 1854, a party of six under the leadership of
David Lewis went west from Harmony to Mountain Meadows,
down the Santa Clara and thence back over the mountains. On
the trip, they preached to the Indians and baptized one hundred
and nineteen into the Mormon Church, advising them thereafter
not to steal or fight, but to learn Mormon ways of living. Two
Indians were sent as messengers to the Muddy River Indians
in Nevada, &ldquo;To tell them we would come among them if they
wanted us.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a></p>
<p>The settlers at Harmony found a better location a few miles
farther upstream on Ash Creek and during the summer of 1854
moved thither, calling it New Harmony. They built a fort there
that fall. The missionaries in the Virgin and Santa Clara valleys
found their remoteness inconvenient; accordingly a settlement
was made on the Santa Clara where they could live among the
Indians, and on December 1, Jacob Hamblin, Thales Haskell,
Ira Hatch, Samuel Knight and A. P. Hardy established the nucleus
of a permanent colony. Two weeks later Rufus Allen and
Hyrum Burgess left Harmony for Tonaquint on the Santa Clara
near its junction with the Virgin River where they built three
log cabins. The missionaries helped the Indians construct substantial
dams and ditches for diverting irrigation water. The
first dam across the Santa Clara Creek, built in 1855, was a feat
which aroused much enthusiasm among the Indians, five hundred
of whom gathered to watch its completion. When the dam
(100 feet long and 14 feet high) was finished and the water began
to rise and run out, half on one side for the Indians and half on
the other for the whites, a great shout of exultation went up from
the dusky spectators.</p>
<p>The hard labor and poor nourishment which Jacob Hamblin
had endured brought on a spell of sickness. To procure medicines
and proper food for him, Gus Hardy went to Parowan.
While there, Mrs. Nancy Anderson, a southerner, asked him
about the mission of the Santa Clara and learned of the long,
warm growing season. Believing that the climate might be suitable
for cotton, she gave him a quart of cotton seed which she
had brought with her from her old home. The missionaries
planted the seed on the Santa Clara and raised a crop during
the summer of 1855. This cotton was carded, spun, and woven
into cloth by the women at the mission. Some of this cloth was
sent to Salt Lake City and aroused no little interest there. Samples
of the cloth even found their way into England and were
said to compare favorably with cotton grown elsewhere. This
was the beginning of cotton culture there, which finally led to
the fuller settlement of the &ldquo;Utah Dixie&rdquo; along the Virgin River,
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
much as the iron industry had led to the development of Iron
County. Moreover, like the iron industry, it answered a temporary
need by supplying clothing when it was impracticable to
import cotton.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>A sad mishap occurred at the mission late in 1855, when a
young Indian living at the home of Thales Haskell, while examining
a gun, accidentally shot the missionary&rsquo;s young wife, Maria
Woodbury Haskell. The death, naturally, cast a pall of gloom
over the mission.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></p>
<p>The missionaries continued their work with the Indians and
gained some ascendency over them. This served a useful purpose
during the next few years in deterring or preventing Indian
thievery and attacks on travelers on the Mormon trail along the
upper part of the Santa Clara. Jules Remy, about to leave the
Santa Clara on his way to the Pacific coast (November 10, 1855)
says: &ldquo;There was a log hut there made by the Mormon missionaries,
who occasionally come to this place to teach the natives
farming.&rdquo; Here a band of Indians crowded around Remy&rsquo;s camp,
causing some alarm. Thinking to impress the Indians, Remy&rsquo;s
party indulged in a little target practice and revealed some expert
markmanship. The Indians, not to be outdone, gathered in a line
to shoot at a target about a hundred yards distant. At a signal
from the chief, the arrows were released in unison and flew to the
mark. Remy noticed that even the youngsters were able to hit
small birds flying close at hand. The Indians were not intent
on injury, but merely on theft, and hoped by their numbers to distract
the attention of the whites while they pilfered the camp.
The Frenchman, however, proved a match for them.<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></p>
<p>Another cotton crop matured in 1856. During that year
there were further accessions to the missionary colony and a rock
fort was built. Though the Indians as a whole were friendly
enough, there was always danger lurking and the fort was at
least a symbol of safety.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1857, twenty-eight families (160 persons),
mostly converts from the South and experienced cotton farmers,
were called to go to the Virgin River to undertake cotton culture
on a larger scale. They were enthused with the prospect
of a warm climate where cotton could be grown and fondly referred
to the Virgin Valley as &ldquo;Utah&rsquo;s Dixie.&rdquo; They arrived
May 5, 1857, at the present site of Washington and immediately
set to work diverting water for irrigation, clearing land, plowing
and planting. Hopes of good crops were doomed, however,
for the cotton was almost a complete failure. Some became discouraged
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
with the location and scattered, a few families locating
at Tonaquint on the Santa Clara just above its junction with the
Virgin.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p>
<p>This failure did not kill the idea of raising cotton in Dixie,
but further experiments were necessary before the industry could
properly expand. In January, 1857, a small company had been
fitted out in Salt Lake City under Joseph Home to establish an
experimental cotton farm on the Virgin River. They arrived in
early February and located on the Virgin just below its junction
with the Santa Clara. Dams and ditches were constructed and
land cleared and planted by May 6. The crop was harvested
and hauled back to Salt Lake City. The total cost of raising this
first crop, including all expenses of the trip to and from Salt Lake
City, was $3.40 per pound. A similar experiment the next season
reduced the price per pound to $1.90.<a class="fn" id="fr_43" href="#fn_43">[43]</a></p>
<p>In the meantime, other settlers had been looking enviously
toward the warm semi-tropical lands of the Virgin Valley. As
early as 1854, Brigham Young had inquired about the possibilities
of building a road into the valley from Cedar City, but the cost of
construction over &ldquo;the black-ridge&rdquo; barrier seemed prohibitive.
In 1858, with the advice and consent of Isaac C. Haight, bishop
of Cedar City, six families moved down Ash Creek and settled
Toquerville. These included Joshua T. Willis, John Willis,
Samuel Pollock, William Riggs, Josiah Reeves and Willis Young,
all of whom had been attracted by the stories of cotton-raising.</p>
<p>The movement had already received considerable impetus
and the Mormon leaders desired more information about the possibilities
of settlement. Nephi Johnson, a young missionary among
the Virgin River Indians, and who had been Indian interpreter
for many emigrant parties passing over the Mormon Trail, was
called by Brigham Young to explore the Virgin River farther
upstream and hunt for suitable places for settlement.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1858 he rode from Cedar City to Toquerville,
where he fraternized with the Indians and persuaded them to
guide him up the river. They led him over the Hurricane Fault
which had hitherto blocked progress of the missionaries upstream.
He explored the upper Virgin River and thus was probably the
first white man to enter both Parunuweap and Zion Canyons.
He says in his autobiography that in September, 1858, he went
into the upper Virgin River valley as far as the site of Shunesburg
and reported that a settlement could be made where Virgin
was later built.<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a></p>
<p>He does not mention Zion Canyon, but his daughter, Lovina
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
A. J. Farnsworth<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> relates that her father often told her of visiting
it. According to her account, he followed the Virgin River with
his Indian guide and reached Oak Creek, above the present site
of Springdale, where the Indian stopped and refused to go any
farther. Wai-no-pits, he said, might be found up there in the
shadows of the narrow canyon. But the Indian agreed to wait
there if Johnson insisted on going on, provided he returned before
the sun (tab) went down. It is not known how far Johnson
went up the canyon, but later, recalling his experience, he used to
say that there were places where the &ldquo;sun never shone&rdquo; because
the walls were so high and the canyon so narrow. He was gone
much longer than he expected, and when he returned, the sun
was setting and the Indian had his arm over the horse ready to
mount and depart.</p>
<p>Back at Cedar City, Johnson was sent to found a settlement
at Virgin. He gathered a small group together and set out in
early December. On the 6th, they began building a road over
the Hurricane Fault below Toquerville and drove their wagons
into Virgin on the 20th, over a route since known as the &ldquo;Johnson
Twist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the fall of 1860, Philip Klingensmith led five other families
from Iron County over the Johnson Twist, and passing up the Virgin
River selected a spot two or three miles above Grafton
where water could be diverted for irrigation, and founded a settlement
called Adventure (between Grafton and Rockville).</p>
<p>In 1861, Brigham Young paid his first visit to the Dixie
settlements. Leaving Salt Lake City on May 15, he reached
Cedar City about the 22nd and followed the Mormon Trail westward
to Pinto and the Mountain Meadows, then southward down
the Santa Clara Creek. He left the trail where it struck over the
hills toward the Beaver Dam Wash, and followed the stream
down to the Santa Clara mission, then comprising thirty-four
men, thirty houses and two hundred and fifty acres under cultivation.
Several orchards and vineyards were already producing
apples, peaches, apricots, plums, nectarines, pears, quinces,
almonds, figs, English walnuts, gooseberries, currants, and grapes
of both Isabella and California Mission varieties. The cotton
crop and casaba melons were flourishing.</p>

<p>The next day he drove to Tonaquint at the junction of the
Santa Clara and the Virgin. This was the strategic point at
which Jedediah Smith&rsquo;s two trips had forked in 1826 and 1827;
where Parley P. Pratt&rsquo;s exploring party had turned homeward
on January 1, 1850; and where John D. Lee&rsquo;s party on February
3, 1852, had halted in the exploration of the Virgin River. After
Brigham Young left Tonaquint, a settlement of twelve families,
he stopped his carriage near the center of the valley in which St.
George was later located. As members of his party crowded
around him, he seemed to envision the future. On his left, running
north and south, was a black ridge. Three miles to the east
was a parallel black ridge. Fronting him two miles to the north
was a red sandstone bluff running east and west, down the face
of which were streaks of vivid green vegetation marking springs
or streams. The Virgin River behind him made the fourth side
of the square. According to Bleak, Young prophesied: &ldquo;There
will yet be built between those volcanic ridges a city with spires,
towers and steeples; with homes containing many inhabitants.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></p>
<p>The party then proceeded up the Virgin River via Washington,
Toquerville and Virgin as far as Grafton. From here it
retraced its steps to Toquerville and then started homeward via
Harmony, Cedar City and Parowan, arriving in Salt Lake City on
June 8, 1861.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Wave</h3>
<p>It was this trip to the Virgin River settlements that convinced
Brigham Young and other Mormon leaders of the wisdom
of pushing the settlement of Utah&rsquo;s southland. The outbreak of
the Civil War may have clinched the argument. When it became
apparent that the cotton supply from the southern states would
be cut off, the decision to advance the Dixie settlements with a
view toward cotton culture was strengthened.</p>
<p>By this time moreover, there was sufficient evidence from
settlers and the experimental farm to prove the practicality of
cotton as a staple crop. During the summer of 1861, plans were
laid for more extensive colonization. Heretofore, the settlements
had been outposts of Iron County. Now the region was to come
into its own as a separate colony with the central settlement to
be located in the valley above Tonaquint, and to be named St.
George.</p>
<p>At the general church conference in Salt Lake City on October
6, about three hundred families were &ldquo;called&rdquo; to the Dixie
Mission to accelerate the cotton industry. Many of these people
were abruptly informed of what awaited them when they heard
their names read out, but most of them responded with good will.
The families were carefully selected in such a way as to insure
balanced communities: farmers, businessmen, educators, carpenters,
masons, blacksmiths, entertainers; all in the proportions
needed.<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a></p>
<p>The colonists got under way in November with Apostles
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
George A. Smith, Erastus Snow and Orson Pratt, as leaders. Towards
the end of the month the vanguard stood at the forks of the
road west of Toquerville at the parting of the ways up and down
the river. The leaders had already traveled upstream looking
over possible locations, going through the settlements of Virgin,
Grafton, Adventure and up both forks of the Virgin River into
Zion and Parunuweap canyons, investigating the agricultural
lands along the way.<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a> How far they went up Zion Canyon is
unknown. Erastus Snow later reported that ten miles above
Grafton the mountains closed in, leaving but a narrow gorge,
through which the east fork of the Virgin forced its way, allowing
no room for the passage of man or beast. His factual report
indicated no wonder at the marvels he must have beheld. The
sense of awe awakened today by such inspiring spectacles of
nature&rsquo;s handiwork appears to have been largely lacking in the
hard-working pioneers who spent all their energy in wringing
a meager existence from the wilderness.</p>
<p>At the forks of the road, the paths divided. A few went
upstream with Orson Pratt, but the majority went down, arriving
in early December at the site of St. George. Other settlements
quickly sprang up along the length of the Virgin Valley wherever
water could be diverted for irrigation. Thus the &ldquo;cotton-wave&rdquo;
ushered many pioneers into the Virgin River valleys and
insured the growth of the area.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">Settlement of Zion Canyon</span></h2>
<p>The cotton migrations were the prelude to the settlement of
Parunuweap and Zion canyons. Because of a disagreement with
Erastus Snow, Orson Pratt did not go to St. George, but led his
group over the Johnson Twist up the Virgin River to the last outpost
at Adventure (the lower end of the present Rockville fields),
arriving in late November or early December, 1861. Here he
paused long enough to gather information and make plans for settlement.</p>
<p>Coming up the river, Pratt undoubtedly conferred with Nephi
Johnson and other settlers at Virgin, Old Grafton and Adventure.
Members of the expedition, of course, went scouting for themselves,
but the advice of Johnson probably led some of them to
decide upon Shunesburg, where on his visit in 1858 he had reported
a settlement could be made.</p>
<p>Adventure was a small place with limited prospects for expansion
but just above it was a much larger tract of land requiring
more extensive irrigation. A townsite was selected on the bench
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
high above the river, and at a meeting held at Old Grafton on December
13, it was decided to name the new townsite Rockville because
of the many boulders along the foot of the hill where it was
located.</p>
<p>Of those who went up the river above Adventure, three families
stopped at the forks of the Virgin at a place afterward called
Northrop, while six continued up the Parunuweap four or five
miles to the farm of an old Indian named Shunes. They purchased
the land for a trifling consideration, but the price proved to be only
the first installment, for the old Indian continued to live in the vicinity
for many years, working and begging for food from the
whites to add to his native supply of seeds, lizards and wild game.</p>
<p>The settlers were hardly located when a stormy period began.
They were digging irrigation ditches and cutting timber for log
houses, but were still living in their covered wagons when bad
weather set in. Rain started on Christmas day, 1861, and continued
for forty days. The Virgin became a raging torrent and,
at least twice, great floods washed out the dams, filled the ditches,
undermined banks, overflowed the plains and despoiled valuable
farm lands. On January 8, the flood inundated the village of Grafton,
the water rising suddenly during the night. As the waters
swirled around the wagon box home of Nathan Tenney, several
men picked it up with his expectant wife in it and carried it to
higher ground north of the river, where a son was born. He was
named, appropriately enough, Marvelous Flood Tenney.</p>
<p>After the floods subsided Old Grafton was abandoned and a
new site was selected on the south bank on a higher bench a little
farther upstream. The area was surveyed and laid off in town
lots and fields. A new ditch costing $5,000 was dug within the
next year. The new townsite of Rockville was similarly laid off
into lots and fields during the summer of 1862, and an irrigation
ditch was completed in time for use during 1863. In the meantime
the settlers at Adventure continued to cultivate the land irrigated
by their first ditch. At the forks of the river at Northrop, a ditch
was built by James Lemon and others to irrigate a stretch of land
below the junction of the two forks of the streams. At Shunesburg,
the town and fields were surveyed and ditches constructed to
divert the water from both Shunes Creek and the east fork of the
Virgin.</p>
<p>The known settlers in Adventure included the following: Orson
Pratt, Dr. S. A. Kenner, John C. Hall, Henry Stocks, William
Ashton, and Elijah Newman. Those at Northrop included James
Lemon, Isaac Behunin, and probably Joseph Black. The following
went to Shunesburg, all of them having come together from San
Pete Valley: Oliver DeMille, Hyrum Stevens, Alma Millett,
George Petty, Hardin Whitlock and Charlie Klapper.</p>
<p>Whether anyone was located at Springdale at that time is debatable.
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
E. C. Behunin says that his father, Isaac, stayed at
Northrop until after the flood and then moved to Springdale where
others had already located. Nevertheless, it is the impression of
several early pioneers of the region that Albert Petty was the first
settler of Springdale in the fall or winter of 1862-3. It is related
that he took his wife to the spot he had selected beside some large
springs and asked her to name it. She called it Springdale. It is
probable, however, that the lower Springdale irrigation ditch was
taken out early in 1862. It is also probable that Joseph Black came
with the main group in 1861 despite his journal date of 1862, written
in his old age.<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a> His parents came in 1861 and it is almost certain
that he was with them. He is credited by three different
sources with being the first to explore Zion Canyon after the settlers
arrived, although he says nothing about it.<a class="fn" id="fr_50" href="#fn_50">[50]</a></p>
<p>When Albert Petty came to Shunesburg, he brought with
him the rock grinding stones for a grist mill. Not finding a suitable
mill site at Shunesburg, he and his son, George, moved to the newly
surveyed town of Springdale where they set up the mill that
served as a public utility in grinding the coarse flour for the settlers
of the upper Virgin.</p>
<p>The fall of 1862 saw another influx of settlers. Another general
&ldquo;call&rdquo; for 250 men to go south was issued Sunday, October 19,
and many others volunteered to go to Dixie. Charles L. Walker
describes the incident in his journal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sunday, October 19, 1862.... Went up to the Bowery....
At the close of the meeting, 250 men were called
to go to the cotton country. My name was on the list and
was read off the stand.</p>
<p>At night I went to a meeting in the Tabernacle of
those who had been called. Here I learned a principle
that I shan&rsquo;t forget in a while. It showed me that obedience
is a great principle in Heaven and on earth. Well,
here I have worked for the last seven years, through heat
and cold, hunger and adverse circumstances, and at last
have a home and a lot with fruit trees just beginning to
bear and look pretty. Well, I must leave it and go and
do the will of my Father in Heaven ... and I pray God
to give me strength to accomplish that which is required
of me.</p>
<p>Monday, October 20, to Wednesday, October 22.
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
Not very well. Working around the home and fixing
to dispose of my property.<a class="fn" id="fr_51" href="#fn_51">[51]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spirit of &ldquo;moving south&rdquo; had been encouraged by the
previous year&rsquo;s migration and many had become interested, some
because of friends or relatives who had preceded them, others because
of crop losses or because they were seeking better places to
locate. John Langston, who came to Rockville at this time, says
in his journal that he had tired of having his crops eaten up by
crickets at Alpine, Utah County, so tried farming at Draper. His
crops in 1862 were destroyed by flooding of the Jordan River,
so he volunteered and was &ldquo;called&rdquo; on the mission to settle Dixie.<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a></p>
<p>These recruits enlarged the settlements even to overcrowding.
Rockville suddenly expanded by the abandonment of Adventure
and the influx of new settlers to a town of nearly thirty families.<a class="fn" id="fr_53" href="#fn_53">[53]</a>
Shunesburg increased to fifteen or sixteen and the others
in proportion.<a class="fn" id="fr_54" href="#fn_54">[54]</a> The townsite and fields of early Springdale were
surveyed during the fall and winter of 1862-63, and a town of
some twenty families was established, with Albert Petty as presiding
elder.<a class="fn" id="fr_55" href="#fn_55">[55]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>With crowded conditions and scanty food supplies, many became
discouraged and some left Dixie. Most, however, proved
faithful to the &ldquo;call&rdquo; and remained to make the settlements permanent.</p>
<p>The settlements were still in a precarious state, the pioneers
moving from place to place attempting to find suitable locations,
some leaving and others coming, when, in 1864, a church census
enumerated 765 persons (129 families), distributed along the upper
Virgin River as follows:</p>

<p>This indicates a considerable decline in population from the previous
year. The settlers had come to Dixie filled with high hopes
of raising cotton, had planted that crop to excess in 1862 and 1863
and had failed to raise enough foodstuffs. They were on famine
rations during the winter of 1863-64 and were not relieved until
summer. Moreover, the difficulties of hauling cotton to the northern
settlements and exchanging it for foodstuffs had driven many
of the settlers away; some returned to their former homes, while
others sought opportunities elsewhere.</p>
<p>Enough cotton was now being grown to create a vexatious
problem of marketing. Bleak records that in the spring of 1864,
11,000 pounds were hauled to California and estimated that 16,000
pounds were still in storage. Some was even hauled to the Missouri
River where it brought a fair price because of the war shortage.
David Bullock and other men from Cedar City, traveling east for
poor emigrants, started out loaded with Dixie cotton. It soon became
necessary to set up machinery for ginning the cotton and
weaving it into cloth. Gins were soon in operation in several
places and hand looms and spinning wheels were found in many
homes.<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></p>
<p>In 1865, Brigham Young personally made plans for the construction
of a cotton mill at Washington. The building was finished
by December, 1866. Later it was sold to a cooperative concern,
the Rio Virgin Manufacturing Company, and more up-to-date
machinery was installed, making it the most complete factory
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
in Utah for the processing of cotton and wool. It continued to
operate until the close of the century.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a></p>
<p>Parunuweap Canyon was fully settled almost from the start,
but Shunesburg gradually declined until today there are but one
or two small farms left. This is due primarily to the ravages of
floods which washed away the good agricultural land. On the
other hand, tillable land in Zion Canyon was not brought under
cultivation for a dozen years or more.</p>
<p>Flat lands suitable for agriculture in Zion were found in two
areas along the canyon floor, separated by a mile or more of rocky,
steep-sided canyon difficult to travel. The lower area, in which
Springdale was located, was a narrow valley less than a mile wide
and four or five miles long separated from the Parunuweap fork
of the river by a reef of Shinarump Conglomerate, more resistant
to erosion than the overlying Chinle shales in which the valley
had been cut. The upper area was an old lake bed filled by sediments.
It extended from the old blockade in the river below the
Court of the Patriarchs that had anciently produced the lake, nearly
five miles upstream to the Temple of Sinawava. It was much
narrower than the lower unit and the tillable land was scattered in
narrow fields along the banks.</p>
<p>Joseph Black seems to have been the first to investigate
the upper area, probably in the late fall of 1861 or 1862. The difficulties
of reaching the upper part of Zion were too great, however,
and he finally located in the lower valley. His descriptions of the
canyon were such that the cynical referred to it sometimes as
&ldquo;Joseph&rsquo;s Glory.&rdquo; Nevertheless his stories were listened to and some
scoffers remained to pray. E. C. Behunin says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was Joseph Black who interested my father in Zion
Canyon. Black had made a trip into the canyon before
we came here and in talking to my father, he had praised
it so highly that my father became interested and moved
up into the canyon upon Black&rsquo;s advice and suggestion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isaac Behunin had come to Dixie in the fall of 1861 and settled
at Northrop until the flood in January, 1862, after which he
moved to Springdale and built a home. In addition to farming in
Springdale he visited Zion in the summer of 1863 and started some
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
operations there, building a one-room log cabin not far from where
Zion Lodge now stands.<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a></p>
<p>The cabin was a crude shelter used only during the summer,
for the Behunins wintered in Springdale. It was built of cottonwood
logs and the cracks were chinked with mud. The roof had
a ridgepole to which ash and maple sticks were lashed on either
side and covered with corn-fodder and dirt. The single room had
a door and a window with glass panes. At one side was a fireplace,
but the cooking was usually done on a stepstove outside.</p>
<p>The Behunins were real mountaineers, inured to the hardships
of their life. To make a wash basin, they cut down a cottonwood
tree in the dooryard and scooped out a bowl-like depression in the
top of the stump. A hole was bored in the bottom, downward and
outward. This was stopped on the outside by a wooden plug. To
wash, they dipped fresh water into the bowl.</p>
<p>The family included, in addition to the parents, five sons and
one daughter. All except the daughter were confirmed smokers.
Indian tobacco grew well in Zion Canyon in those days and at first
they could gather their supplies from the wild plants. Indeed, their
more censorious neighbors ventured the opinion that the wild
tobacco was the inducement that led the Behunins into Zion
Canyon. Later they introduced domestic varieties.</p>
<p>The cabin seems to have been completed late in the season
after the corn had been harvested. There was no road into Zion
Canyon at that time, but a heavy team had hauled in a plow and
other necessities. An irrigation ditch was dug and the flats cleared
of vines and rosebushes. By the next season several acres were
under cultivation, and fruit trees, cane and garden stuff had been
planted.</p>
<p>The Behunins also owned fifteen or twenty head of cattle all
broken to work, including milk cows. They raised pigs on the
surplus corn and did their own butchering and curing. James H.
Jennings (born in 1853) tells of watching them slaughter thirteen
hogs one day. They filled a shallow pool with water and heated
it by dropping into it hot rocks from a nearby bonfire. When the
water was near boiling, they dipped the hogs in the pool to scald
them and loosen the hair. The meat was cut up and salted to make
old-style home-cured hams, shoulders and bacon.</p>

<p>Mrs. Eunice Munk of Manti, who as a girl of 12 or 14 spent
more than a year in Springdale, recalled that in the summer of
1864 the Behunins told her that in Zion Canyon the chickens went
to roost soon after sundown, but that the twilight was so long that
they would get tired of waiting for darkness and come out again.</p>
<p>Within a few years, other settlers found their way into the
canyon. William Heap took up a farm across the river from the
Behunins at the mouth of Emerald Pool Canyon and built a log
cabin on the west bank of the river north of the Emerald Pool
stream. He planted an orchard and raised annual crops such as
cane, corn, and garden stuff. John Rolf built his cabins above the
Behunins. A polygamist, he needed separate dwellings for his families;
one he located near the Behunins; the other on the site of the
present grotto camp.</p>
<p>Protection was afforded by buck or rip-gut fences from cliff
to river at each end of the farms. These were made of short poles
set in the ground and pointed in various directions so as to effectively
prevent large animals from breaking through.</p>
<p>Hand plows pulled by horses or oxen were used for turning
the soil. Harrows were fashioned of hewn timbers fastened together
in a triangle. Sharpened pegs of oak were fixed in holes
bored in the framework and turned downward so that they
scratched the ground when pulled by a team. The first shovels
were short-handled, but later they had what they called &ldquo;lazy man&rsquo;s
shovels,&rdquo; because the handles were longer and a man did not have
to bend his back so much when working. The rakes were handmade
of wood with sharp pegs for teeth. Scythe and cradle were
seldom used since little hay or grain was raised.</p>
<p>It was about this time that the canyon received its name. The
three settlers, hardy mountaineers though they were, nevertheless
were of a devout and religious turn of mind. It seems to have been
old father Behunin who proposed the name of Zion, to which the
others agreed. Isaac Behunin had been with the Mormons ever
since they left New York. He had helped build the Temple at
Kirtland, Ohio, and had at one time acted as body-guard to the
founder of the Church, Joseph Smith. He had been through all
the &ldquo;drivings of the Saints&rdquo; in Missouri and Illinois and nourished
the typically bitter resentment towards the &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; who had
been responsible for such &ldquo;atrocities.&rdquo; Here in Zion he felt that
at last he had reached a place of safety where he could rest assured
of no more harryings and persecutions. No wonder he proposed
the name Zion, which implies a resting place. He went even further,
maintaining that should the Saints again be harassed by their
enemies, this would become their place of refuge.</p>
<p>On one of Brigham Young&rsquo;s visits to Springdale, probably in
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
1870, he was told of Zion. He inquired how it came to be so
named. The explanation, it seems, was not satisfactory to the
Mormon leader after a toilsome journey into the canyon and he
questioned its propriety, saying that &ldquo;it was not Zion.&rdquo; Some of
his more literal-minded followers thereafter called it &ldquo;Not Zion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first settlers made their way into the canyon on horseback,
using the river bed, crossing and recrossing the stream. It soon
became necessary, however, to provide other means of transportation.
A wagon road was no problem through the flats in both the
upper and lower valleys, but the precipitous canyon between was
baffling. It is related<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> that Hyrum Morris, Shunesburg settler, and
a companion were the first to enter the upper valley by means other
than horseback. They hitched a yoke of oxen to the hind wheels
of a wagon and lashed a plow and supplies on it. When they entered
the canyon, near the present site of the bridge, they climbed the
west bank over the sand bench, down into Birch Creek and thence
into the upper Zion Valley. This did not prove to be a practicable
route, and no one seems to have followed it. Today one can hardly
traverse the route on foot.</p>
<p>The remains of an old cart road which followed the east bank,
high up opposite the sand bench, coming out into the upper valley
about half a mile above the present Union Pacific garage, may still
be traced. This route was used for some years, but was far from
satisfactory. Other settlers from the towns below began to cultivate
tracts in the upper valley and the timber resources of the canyon
made a better road imperative. During the winter of 1864-65,
a wagon road<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a> was built up the river bed, crossing the stream many
times. This is the road which, with minor improvements, served
as the main highway into Zion until the National Park Service built
the road that first made it fully accessible to the public. This road
in turn served until 1930, when the present well-graded highway
was constructed midway between the river and the older road that
it replaced.</p>
<p>It was while constructing this first wagon road on January 9,
1865, that George Ayers was killed. A short dugway was being
graded on the slope above the river. With no blasting powder,
the men were excavating a large boulder, and George Ayers and
Orson Taylor had stopped to rest in the shade of the huge stone,
rolling cigarettes. Suddenly it began to move. A shout of warning
came from Samuel Wittwer and Heber Ayers. Taylor was
able to scramble out of the way but Ayers was squarely in its path
and it fell directly upon him, crushing and killing him instantly&mdash;the
first victim of Zion Canyon.</p>
<p>Indian troubles, treated in a later chapter, broke out in the
spring of 1866. Martial law was declared and instructions were
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
issued from the military headquarters for the settlers to concentrate
in towns of at least 150 families. It was at first decided to
gather all the settlers of the Upper Virgin River at Rockville and
Toquerville, and later, at Virgin. James Jepson<a class="fn" id="fr_61" href="#fn_61">[61]</a> recalls that his
father had just moved his cabin from Virgin to Rockville when the
revised decision reached him and he moved back to Virgin again.
This was the fifth time the cabin had been moved and his father
dryly remarked that it was so used to the process now that all he
had to do was throw the logs into the yard and they would fit themselves
together.</p>
<p>This concentration order meant the abandonment of all smaller
places: Duncan, Grafton, Northrop, Shunesburg, Springdale
and Zion. Those who could not buy or rent a house simply dumped
their belongings in the shade and set up housekeeping under the
trees. Some moved their log houses with them, others made dugouts
and still others built new log houses.</p>
<p>Although the outlying towns had been abandoned, the crops
had been planted and had to be tended. Workers went in armed
groups of ten, twenty, or thirty to the fields, usually remaining during
the week in the more distant places and returning to Rockville
on Sunday. In Zion, headquarters were at the Behunin cabin,
where eight or ten men usually camped while working the crops.
In Springdale, they usually stayed at Albert Petty&rsquo;s home or nearby.
Petty himself refused to abandon his ranch and stayed there
throughout the Indian scare.</p>
<p>This concentration continued through 1867, but with the close
of the &ldquo;Black Hawk War&rdquo; and the subsidence of troubles with the
Paiutes, there was a general reoccupation of the villages except
Long Valley and Kanab, abandoned during the Indian troubles.
This occasioned some shifts in the population; some returned to
their former homes and lands, some stayed where they were, and
a few moved elsewhere. Springdale was reoccupied by Albert
Petty and several other families, but it did not regain its former
size until about 1874. Shunesburg and Grafton also seem to have
lost slightly in population in the reshuffling. To Zion, however,
the same settlers, Behunin, Heaps and Rolfs, returned and took up
their usual tasks of raising crops and tending livestock.</p>
<p>The following years were prosperous and the settlements
were greatly strengthened. Markets were established in northern
Utah, at mining camps in southern Nevada, and even in California.
Commerce was restricted because of transportation difficulties but
it was an important factor in helping to balance needs by exchange
of livestock products and cotton for goods the settlers could not
produce.</p>
<p>The national financial panic of 1873 gradually worked its
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
paralyzing effects into Utah and spread to the southern Utah
colonies. The repercussions were not marked on the Virgin River,
but Brigham Young was gravely concerned about the more general
conditions in Utah when he came to St. George to spend his
second winter there (November, 1873).</p>
<p>During the spring of 1874 he initiated near St. George a communistic
movement known as the United Order. An experiment
of similar nature had been tried by the Mormons in Missouri more
than thirty years earlier. It was an attempt to combine cooperatively
the efforts of the Saints, so that all might share the benefits in accordance
with their needs. The scheme had been inaugurated in
a few communities with encouraging success and it was now proposed
to launch it on a large scale.<a class="fn" id="fr_62" href="#fn_62">[62]</a> In February, St. George, Price
City, and Washington were all organized on this basis. Price
City, near St. George, is reported as the first working farm community
in which the combined farms were managed as a unit and
the farmers lived as one large family. Some of the men were assigned
to irrigation, some to raising hay, corn, cane, garden stuff,
or other crops according to the estimated needs of the community.
Fuel was supplied seasonably by hauling wood from the scrub
forests of the hills. The women were assigned as cooks, dish washers,
baby tenders, clothes makers, and nurses. In Price and a few
other places the settlers ate together, but in most of the communities
each family had its own home.</p>
<p>On March 5, Brigham Young visited Virgin and Rockville
and organized the United Order. During March and April, nearly
all the settlements in Dixie fell in line and a confederation of all
the settlements, known as the St. George Stake United Order, was
set up to correlate the activities of the individual settlements.</p>
<p>During late April and early May, Brigham Young moved
northward to Salt Lake City, initiating the novel movement in many
of the towns along the way, including Cedar, Parowan, Beaver,
Fillmore and Nephi. Upon reaching Salt Lake City, a general
agency to correlate the stake activities, known as the &ldquo;United Order
for all the World,&rdquo; was established.</p>
<p>The movement enjoyed only a brief period of prosperity. The
utopian ideal encountered difficulties when it came to the division
of benefits. Wages were assigned to each person and the benefits
drawn were charged against each family. It was soon alleged that
some were drawing more than their wages entitled them to, whereas
others were not getting all that they felt they should.</p>
<p>In a few favored communities having access to large natural
resources, such as abundant pasturage for livestock, either dairy
or range, the produce was more than sufficient to pay the wages
assigned and to build up a surplus capital. In most, however,
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
where agriculture was the chief dependence and products of the
farms were insufficient to pay wages, stinting was inevitable. Under
such conditions, there was general dissatisfaction with the cooperative
scheme and more progressive individuals sought to withdraw.</p>
<p>Many settlements abandoned the experiment at the end of
the first season. Such was the case at Rockville, but Shunesburg
and Springdale held on for another year, through 1875. A new
ditch on higher ground was dug at Springdale at this time and the
town was moved to its present location, half a mile north of its
old site. This offered opportunity for expansion. The Gifford
family from Shunesburg and several families from Rockville came
to join the United Order in 1875.</p>
<p>It seems to have been the United Order movement which depopulated
Zion Canyon. In 1872, Isaac Behunin, getting old, sold
out to William Heap for two hundred bushels of corn, and moved
to Mt. Carmel, then beginning to be resettled, where he later died.
With the establishment of the United Order in Rockville in 1874,
Heap and Rolf joined, turning over their property in Zion to the
corporation. With the collapse of the Order in the fall, they withdrew
their share of the proceeds and moved to Bear Lake and later
to Star Valley, Wyoming.</p>
<p>These families were the last to live regularly in Zion Canyon.
Farming, however, was still carried on by settlers living in the
village below. Such names as Dennett, Gifford, Petty, Russell,
Terry, Dalton, Crawford, Stout and Flanigan, recur as farmers in
Zion in the following years. Oliver D. Gifford, long-time bishop
of Springdale, related that about 1880 he was farming the land
south of the river and west of the Great White Throne at the site
of the grotto camp when the Great Red Arch fell out, the rock
pulverizing and covering up a spring and large pine trees.</p>
<h3>The Cable</h3>
<p>Zion, since its discovery, had been regarded as a blind canyon.
Even the Indian name, I-oo-goon (canyon like an arrow quiver),
reflects this idea. Lee, Smith, Steele and their companions, who
left Parowan on June 12, 1852, and explored the head-waters of
the Sevier and Virgin, were balked by the Vermillion cliffs nearby,
if not in Zion, in contemplating the possibilities of a road from the
mountains to the lower valleys.</p>
<p>The early settlers of Rockville, needing timber from the mountains,
had explored the probabilities of a road through the canyon
without success. James H. Jennings recalls hearing Elijah Newman,
an early settler of Rockville, tell that a team could be driven
from the head of Parowan Canyon over Cedar Mountain to the
rim of Zion Canyon and that he believed that some day a way
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
would be found through the cliffs so that timber could be hauled
down from the mountain.</p>
<p>Brigham Young himself had encouraged the idea on one of
his trips to the upper Virgin, probably in 1863. It is related that
when the settlers were bewailing the lack of timber for flooring
their cabins, he stated in public meeting that the day would come
when hundreds of thousands of feet of lumber would be brought
down the canyon. The wise ones shook their heads and remarked
that their leader had missed it this time.</p>
<p>During the early seventies the mail from St. George to Kanab
was routed via Shunesburg. It was lifted over the 1,500 foot cliff
at the head of Shunesburg canyon on wires<a class="fn" id="fr_63" href="#fn_63">[63]</a> arranged in such a
way that the man at the top bringing the mail from Kanab could
exchange with the man below, carrying it down the river. This
short-cut saved a day&rsquo;s travel over the road via Pipe Springs and
the Arizona Strip.</p>
<p>It was not until the new century had dawned, however, that
young David Flanigan, who was but a small boy in the days of
the Shunesburg wire-pulley apparatus, conceived the idea of lowering
lumber over the cliffs by means of cables. As a lad of 15, in
the spring of 1888, he and three other boys hunting on the East
Rim of Zion had seen a large grove of yellow pine sawtimber and
had stood at the top of the cliff later known as Cable Mountain,
where the precipice appeared to reach almost to the floor of the
canyon. The problem of lumber remained as acute then as it was
in the days of his parents.</p>
<p>Ten years later, needing lumber for himself, he was forced
to go to the Trumbull or Kaibab mountains, a trip requiring a full
week. The advantage of obtaining lumber nearer home on the
rim of Zion thus impressed itself upon him. He advocated the idea
of lowering it on a cable but found no supporters. Convinced of
the practical wisdom of the idea, he undertook the work alone in
1900. He bought 50,000 feet of wire and stretched it around pulleys
and drums at top and bottom making a circular series, half of
which had three wires, and half five. The five-ply half was to run
around the drum where the weight would be greatest.</p>
<p>After two or three years of experimenting with pulleys and
wire tension, he finally perfected his device. To cut the timber, he
bought an old saw-mill in the summer or fall of 1904. Thus Flanigan&rsquo;s
ingenuity made it possible for vast quantities of lumber to go
down Zion Canyon. By Christmas, 1906, two hundred thousand
feet of sawed lumber had actually been lowered on his cable.</p>
<p>It was during the summer of 1906 that the writer first visited
Zion Canyon. From Orderville he faced a trip by horse to his
home in St. George. Rather than retrace his steps by way of
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
Kanab and Pipe Springs, he inquired about the short-cut via Zion
and was directed cross-country to the head of the old East Rim
trail, which John Winder had recently made barely passable. Belated,
he reached the top of the trail at sundown, and familiar as he
was with mountaineering, started unhesitatingly on the 3,000 foot
descent. Darkness found him well along the trail which grew increasingly
hard to follow. About half way down, he met Winder
and some cowboys coming up. They described the trail and said
they had just lost a pack horse which had rolled over the cliffs below
and they had been delayed in retrieving the pack.</p>
<p>A full moon was just coming up over the cliffs at his back,
throwing light into the dark recesses along the way. With its help
the steep, dangerous places on the trail were negotiated without
difficulty. The dead pack horse was found beside the trail and
the bottom of the canyon was reached about 11 p.m., when the full
moon was shining into the depths of the canyon and towers and
temples were illumined with snowy brightness. Camping there,
he slept out the night in his saddle blankets under the enchanting
witchery of the starry heavens between the brilliant walls that
seemed to reach the sky.</p>
<p>In 1906 Flanigan sold out to Alfred P. Stout<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> and O. D. Gifford.
They replaced his wire cable with a heavier twisted rope
cable, which served for many years and over which millions of feet
of lumber were lowered into the canyon and hauled to the settlements
farther downstream. Stout established a shingle mill in
Zion Canyon about a quarter of a mile below the cable and near
the foot of the northeast corner of the Great White Throne. At
first, large cottonwood logs were cut for shingles, but as these
proved of inferior quality, yellow pine logs were supplied via cable.
The shingle mill was washed away by floods two years later.</p>
<p>A sad accident occurred at the top of the cable on July 28,
1908. A party of young people vacationing on the east rim went
over to see the cable operate from the top. Three of them were
standing in the box at the edge, directly under the cable, looking
into the depths of the canyon, when a bolt of lightning struck the
cable, killing Thornton Hepworth, Jr., and stunning Clarinda
Langston and Lionel Stout. Miss Langston fell limp on the edge
of the box where she was in imminent danger of plummeting down
the cliff. Miss Elza Stout, uninjured nearby, rescued her from
the precarious position, but before assistance could be rendered him,
a second bolt struck the wire and killed Lionel Stout. Miss Langston
recovered, but the bodies of the two boys were lowered into
the canyon over the cable.</p>
<p>It was more than a year later when people started to &ldquo;ride the
cable.&rdquo; About the middle of September, 1910, soon after Zion
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
had been proclaimed a national monument, some members of Scott
P. Stewart&rsquo;s surveying party visited the top of the cable. They
were told that a dog had been sent up from below and that he was
nearly crazy when he reached the top. Quinby Stewart, a fearless
youth, told them that if they would bring some watermelons up to
the foot, he would go down on the cable and help eat them. True to
his word, when the melons arrived he climbed on a load of lumber
ready to be lowered, and holding to the cable, rode safely to the
bottom. It was a swift flight of two minutes, and to a young man
of his disposition a rousing thrill. Others followed suit, and after
eating the melons, rode back to the top in the empty cage.</p>
<p>Riding the cable proved an attraction for those gifted with
strong nerves. At a later date, Frank Petty came to operate the
sawmill at the top of the cliff. He was a large man, weighing nearly
300 pounds, too heavy to travel comfortably up and down the
trails, and the road around the Arizona strip to his home in Rockville
being too long for convenience, he took to riding the cable.
On one occasion, as he started down, the lumber on which he was
riding struck the top of the cliff and loosened the chain holding one
end of the load. His son, Frank, operating the brakes at the top,
seeing the mishap, applied the brakes just in time to prevent his
father from falling down the face of the 1,800 foot declivity. With
a few inches of the lumber still clinging to the edge and his father
paralyzed with fear and afraid to move for fear of jarring it loose,
Frank climbed underneath and re-fastened the chain. With a sigh
of relief, he then lowered his father in safety to the bottom.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">Kane County and Arizona</span></h2>
<p>Just as the settlement of Iron County had provided a stepping
stone to the exploration and settlement of the Virgin River Valley,
so in turn, the latter served in like stead in opening up Kane County
and the Kaibab National Forest of northern Arizona.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1858, after Albert Sydney Johnston&rsquo;s army had
entered Utah, Brigham Young, still doubtful about the future, instructed
missionaries under Jacob Hamblin&rsquo;s leadership to cross
the Colorado River to the southeast and visit the Moquis or Town
Indians with the object of exploring the possibilities of retreating
with his people to this region should the difficulties with the army
become unbearable.<a class="fn" id="fr_65" href="#fn_65">[65]</a></p>
<p>Accordingly, Jacob Hamblin, one of the leading figures in
Utah&rsquo;s southern frontier, left the Santa Clara on October 28, 1858,
with a party of twelve, including an Indian guide, a Spanish interpreter,
and a Welsh interpreter, the last because of wildly erroneous
reports that the Moquis spoke a variant of that tongue.
The Indian led them through the Arizona strip via Pipe Springs
and Kaibab to the old Ute ford where Escalante had crossed
eighty-two years earlier. The visit to the Moquis was brief, some
of the men returning in November, the others later in the winter.
This expedition revealed the general topography between the
Virgin and Colorado.</p>

<p>A second missionary expedition to the Moquis was undertaken
in the fall of 1859, leaving the Santa Clara headquarters on October
20 and reaching the Moquis on November 6. Hamblin appointed
Marion J. Shelton and Thales Haskell to remain there for
the winter and returned home with the rest of the party.<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> Friendship
with the Moquis was cultivated by the missionaries, but this
seems to have led to difficulties with the Navajo.<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a></p>
<p>When Jacob Hamblin led a third expedition across the Colorado
River to reach the Moquis in the fall of 1860, he was met by a
band of unfriendly Navajos who would not let the missionaries
proceed and debated whether to kill them or let them go home.
With the Mormons were several Indians, including two squaws.
The Navajos offered to let the party go in peace if they would leave
the squaws. This Hamblin refused to do, and an agreement was
finally reached whereby the missionaries were allowed to return
home in exchange for goods and ammunition.<a class="fn" id="fr_68" href="#fn_68">[68]</a></p>
<p>They camped that night on a table-rock mesa where there
was only a narrow passageway which was carefully guarded. Next
morning, November 2, 1860, while some were exchanging goods
with the Navajos, others took the horses down to water. As they
were returning, the saddle horse of George A. Smith, Jr., started
off on a side trail and he went after it alone. He found two Indians
leading his horse away. The horse was readily turned over and
Smith started back to camp. One of the Indians rode up alongside
Smith and asked to see his revolver. Suspecting nothing,
Smith handed it over. The Indian, after examining it, passed it
back to the other Indian a few paces behind, who shot Smith three
times. As he fell from his horse, the Indians dismounted and
shot three arrows into his back.</p>
<p>The Indians then blockaded the trail to the Moquis towns,
forcing the Mormons to retreat, who placed the dying man on a
mule and started homeward with the Navajos in hot pursuit.
Traveling thus, it was nearly dark before Smith died. His body
had to be abandoned as the Navajos seemed unwilling to give up
the chase until they had taken his scalp. The balance of the party
returned home safely.</p>
<p>Reporting the loss of George A. Smith, Jr., was a sorrowful
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
duty for Hamblin. The young man&rsquo;s father was deeply shocked,
but like a good Saint, consoled himself with the thought that the
Lord wished his son taken that way. Brigham Young sent instructions
for a company of twenty men to retrieve the remains. Despite
the hardships of mid-winter, they gathered up the few bones that
were left of Smith&rsquo;s body and returned with them for interment.</p>
<p>Several other trips to the Moquis by different routes resulted
in detailed knowledge of northern Arizona and southern Utah.
Crossings of the Colorado were explored thoroughly and ferries
were established at the south of the Virgin, at the mouth of the
Grand Wash (1862) and at the foot of Grand Wash Cliffs about
five miles upstream (Pearce&rsquo;s Ferry, 1863). These supplemented
the old Ute ford in Glen Canyon. Further exploration did not reveal
a more direct route until 1869, when the crossing later known
as Lee&rsquo;s Ferry was discovered. These routes were so well explored
that no better ones have been discovered since.</p>
<p>Stockmen began to graze their herds of cattle and sheep on
the plains of the Arizona strip. Some time prior to 1863, W. B.
Maxwell established a ranch at Short Creek; not long after, James
M. Whitmore located ranches at Pipe Springs and Moccasin, and
Ezra Strong of Rockville settled on Kanab Creek. In the spring
of 1864, several ranches were established in the mountains and two
settlements were started, one at the present site of Kanab, where
a small fort was built, and another housing eight families at Berryville
(later Glendale) in the north end of Long Valley. In the fall,
Priddy Meeks located in the south end of the valley. He was
joined the next spring (1865) by several settlers<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a> from the Virgin
River, who brought livestock for the range and nursery stock for
orchards. The new settlement was called Winsor (later Mt. Carmel).</p>
<p>In the autumn, with indications of an impending rift between
whites and Indians, the Winsor settlers moved to Berryville and
helped build a stockade for protection during the winter. In the
spring they returned and planted crops, but during the summer settlement
was again interrupted by Indian difficulties and had to be
abandoned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">Indian Troubles</span></h2>
<p>The period following early settlement was marked by Indian
troubles with both Paiutes and Navajos. These are sometimes
called the Navajo raids, and in part were an outgrowth of the
&ldquo;Black Hawk War&rdquo; which broke out in Sevier Valley, central
Utah, in 1865. The whites had brought with them their livestock,
which they grazed upon the public domain, turning the cattle and
horses loose and herding the sheep. These animals multiplied rapidly
and quickly depleted the edible fruits and seeds upon which
the Indians subsisted. Indian resentment not unnaturally was inflamed,
and with starvation staring them in the face, there was little
left for them to do but beg or steal.</p>
<p>The Indians had claimed the lands, the vegetation and the
wild game, and although they had given the first white men permission
to come, yet so many others had followed, like the proverbial
camel&rsquo;s nose, that they were destroying the means of subsistence
of the Indians. Not only were seeds and fruits being eaten by the
livestock, but game also was getting scarce and hard to find, due
largely to encroachment of cattle and sheep which were taking the
place of deer upon the range. The white man hunted the Indians&rsquo;
deer so why should not the Indian hunt the white man&rsquo;s cattle?
There was some compensation to the Indians, however; they could
glean in the grain fields of the settlers and gather waste grain as
easily as they could seeds, and pine nut crops were uninjured by the
whites.</p>
<p>Gradually, friendly feelings of the Indians for the settlers
began to deteriorate. Begging in the settlements and the depredations
on the range increased. The Paiutes in some instances aided
and abetted the raiding Navajos, but the majority sided with the
whites. The Navajos were wont to cross the Colorado, scatter into
small bands, make swift raids on the Mormon settlements, gather
up horses, cattle and sheep, and flee back across the river before
they could be overtaken.</p>
<p>From the beginning a military force had been held in readiness
against any emergency. As the southern Utah settlements
expanded, improvements in this organization became advisable. In
May, 1864, the Iron Military District was recast to include Beaver,
Iron, Washington and Kane counties and William H. Dame of
Parowan was named adjutant. Nearly all the eligible men were
enrolled and companies of fifty were organized in towns wherever
that many were available. Companies consisted of five platoons
of ten men each, the first platoon of each company often being
cavalry, the balance infantry. Three companies made a battalion
and about seven battalions made a brigade. The men were occasionally
called together for inspection and drill and sometimes
these included battalion or brigade reviews. Training was emphasized
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
during the Indian troubles between 1865 and 1869. On
February 17, 1866, Erastus Snow, the Mormon leader at St.
George, was elected Brigadier General and brigade headquarters
were transferred from Parowan to St. George.</p>
<p>The Black Hawk War broke out in 1865 and was not settled
until 1868. Nearly 3,000 men were enlisted and the cost was over
a million dollars and at least seventy lives. This Ute unrest was
contagious, and the Paiutes in turn were stirred into sporadic resistance.</p>
<p>Hostilities in the south began late in 1865, when, on December
18, a number of Paiutes raided Kanab and made away with
some horses. During that winter Dr. James M. Whitmore and his
son-in-law, Robert McIntyre, were herding sheep in the vicinity
of Pipe Springs. Soon after the first of the new year, a band of
Navajos and Paiutes stole a herd of Whitmore&rsquo;s sheep. The next
day the two men went in pursuit and failed to return. This was
reported to St. George and a cavalry detachment was organized
under Captain David H. Cannon. As his force appeared inadequate,
he sent an appeal from Pipe Springs for additional support.
D. D. McArthur came from St. George to take charge and brought
with him forty-seven men under James Andrus with wagons and
supplies for an extended trip designed to drive the Navajos across
the Colorado River. When they arrived at Pipe Springs, the snow
was two feet deep and no trace of the sheep or men could be found.
On January 18, they came upon the tracks of two Paiute Indians
following a large steer, tracked them until sundown, and captured
the Indians in the act of killing the beef.</p>
<p>After questioning and torture, hanging by the heels and twisting
of thumbs, one of the Indians admitted that he had dreamed
that Navajos had been there and then revealed the whereabouts of
a camp of Indians about ten miles out. A detachment was sent and
found that it had been moved another five miles. The militia overtook
the camp about sunrise on January 20, killing two Indians and
capturing five.</p>
<p>Third degree methods elicited information about the killing
of Whitmore and McIntyre. The captives led another detachment
to the scene of the killings, where the posse crisscrossed the
area on horseback, uncovering the arm of one of the victims in the
deep snow. Both bodies had bullet wounds and were riddled with
arrows. They had been killed on January 10.</p>
<p>A wagon was sent after the bodies. While the men were recovering
the remains the other detachment with the five Indian
prisoners arrived. These had in their possession much of the clothing
and personal effects of the murdered men. The evidence of
guilt seemed conclusive, so the Indians were turned loose and shot
as they attempted to run. The Navajos who probably assisted in
the killing escaped. The sheep could not be found and it was assumed
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
the Navajos had taken them across the Colorado River. As
pursuit was impossible because of the deep snow the party returned
home. Charles L. Walker of St. George records in his diary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They were brought home in a wagon load of snow, frozen
stiff and in a good state of preservation. I, with others,
washed them and pulled out the arrow points from their
bodies and dressed them in their burial robes. Also went
to the funeral, which was attended by a large concourse
of people.<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On February 19, 1866, two days after Erastus Snow was
elected Brigadier General, Peter Shurtz, who had built a station at
Paria and had kept about twenty Indians around him all winter,
reported that he had lost his cattle and wished to move into the
settlements. He also reported Navajos camped on Paria River
about eight miles below his ranch where the Ute trail reached the
stream.</p>
<p>Further information indicated that the Navajos were concentrated
east of the Colorado at Cottonwood, intending to raid Kane
County in force and that Captain James Andrus with thirty men
had gone to Paria to get Peter Shurtz and his family and to reconnoiter.
No report of this expedition is available, but a letter written
by L. W. Roundy from Kanab on March 9, 1866, tells that Andrus
had left Paria fourteen days earlier headed for an Indian camp
twelve miles south.<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a> At Kanab, three Indians had attempted to
kill Oren Clark in the bottoms near the fort and had started to
drive off the livestock. Four men from the fort rushed in pursuit
and after dark recovered about thirty head of cattle, but the Indians
escaped with about an equal number.</p>
<p>The Indian menace was so serious by this time that Erastus
Snow ordered all stock in the region south of St. George and the
Virgin River as far east as Kanab removed to the north and west
of the lines of settlements so that it would be easier to ward off
Navajo attacks. This was a difficult task because the grazing was
poor around the settlements and the mountains to the northwest
were already filled with livestock.</p>
<p>The threat from the Utes in upper Sevier Valley also became
acute. Menacing behavior of the Indians in this area and in the
Kanab region led to an order from Utah headquarters to General
Erastus Snow (March 15) to send a company of men from Beaver
and Iron counties over to the Sevier River to build and man an outpost
between Circleville and Panguitch. A company of 76 men
led by Captain Silas S. Smith served here from March 21 to November
30, 1866. They established Fort Sanford about ten miles
north of Panguitch and assisted settlers at Circleville to move to
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
safety. At Panguitch, they helped the settlers transform the town
into a fort.</p>
<p>In the meantime, gathering the livestock from the exposed
range was proceeding slowly. A party sent out from Rockville
in April to round up the stock in the vicinity of Maxwell&rsquo;s Ranch,
found the bodies of two men, a woman, and an Indian, killed a few
days before. When the bodies were brought in to Grafton, it was
ascertained that they were young Robert Berry, his wife, Isabel,
and his brother, Joe, who were coming home to Berryville in Long
Valley via the Dixie settlements and the Arizona Strip (a roundabout
way, but the only wagon route at the time). They had left
the Maxwell Ranch on Short Creek on April 2, 1866 when some
Indians (presumably Paiutes), ambushed them.</p>
<p>According to verbal reports, as related by Mrs. John Dennett
of Rockville (then a girl living in Long Valley and who pieced her
story from Indian and white sources), the Berrys fought for their
lives. The Indians shot one of the horses, rendering the wagon useless.
In the fighting, one Indian was shot. Joe Berry loosened
the other horse and tried to escape but was killed in so doing. The
Indians closed in and captured Robert and his wife. They tied
Robert to a wheel where he was forced to watch them torture Isabel,
who was an expectant mother. They shot arrows into her and
laughed at her as she tried to pull them out. Then they shot him
full of arrows. Mrs. Dennett said her father always felt that the
Berrys had been killed in revenge for some Indians slain by Long
Valley men who had found them roasting a beef. At that time
three were slain: an Indian, a squaw and a papoose.</p>
<p>When the Berry tragedy was reported in St. George, orders
were issued forbidding travel unless in groups large enough to provide
adequate safeguards. This led to the declaration of martial
law, May 2, 1866, and to the issuance of instructions to concentrate
the settlers in fortified places of at least 150 men. Patrols were
ordered out in various directions, especially across the trails used
by the Navajos in raiding the Mormon country and in contacting
the rampaging Utes of Sevier County.</p>
<p>When Silas S. Smith, stationed on the Sevier, heard of the
Berry massacre, he found that the Paiute chief at Panguitch had
known about it for five days without reporting it to him. Smith
at once ordered pickets to bring in all passing Indians for questioning.
Friendly Indians responded willingly enough, but when two
strange Indians refused, a skirmish resulted in which one was killed
and the other wounded.</p>
<p>Smith decided to disarm the local Indians and surrounded one
of their camps near Panguitch one morning before daylight and
took their arms. Two visiting Indians were missing from the camp
so he kept a guard awaiting their arrival. When they came, they
showed fight. One of them was killed, whereupon the other surrendered.
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
The next day Smith surrounded another camp soon after
sunrise, but the natives had already fled. However, in the ensuing
melee two more Indians were killed. The arms taken from them
included several guns, many new arrows, and a peck of new arrow
heads. Some escaped to Panguitch Lake and spread the alarm
among the Indians there.</p>
<p>General Snow had a number of chiefs from Panguitch, Parowan,
and Red Creek brought to Parowan for conference. He tried
to pacify them with arguments and presents but insisted that they
must not have arms or ammunition and must have passes in order
to travel through the Mormon settlements. This aroused some resentment,
but on April 25, 1866, they agreed to leave their weapons
at Parowan as a token of friendship. Some of the Indians reported
gunfire around Upper Kanab where Col. W. B. Maxwell
was on lookout for Navajos.</p>
<p>With the declaration of martial law and the order to concentrate
settlers in large towns, the outlying ranchers and people from
the smaller villages began to move into Toquerville, Virgin and
Rockville. In June, General Snow decided to abandon Long Valley.
Mrs. John Dennett, who made the trek as a girl, recalled the
line of wagons leaving Long Valley with armed guards in front
and rear. While crossing the sand hills between there and Kanab,
a small boy was run over and killed. A halt was made while the
child was buried in the sand, but the exigencies of the situation forbade
longer delay and the weeping mother was hastily torn from
the fresh grave.</p>
<p>The settlers&rsquo; train passed Kanab to the left and pushed on toward
Pipe Springs. Near the mouth of Cottonwood Canyon (June
27) they ran into an ambush of Indians who, for some unexplained
reason, failed to attack. J. M. Higbee reports<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a> that they called to
the Indians to come in and talk or be shot. They came in and
talked. According to Mrs. Dennett, there were seven or nine Indians
taken into Pipe Springs for a council of war. The wagons
were driven into a large circle, as was customary in times of danger,
the Indians inside the circle in the center of the group of whites.
Higbee says the Indians were told that if any more were found
along the route of the caravan they would be shot. Mrs. Dennett
adds that some of the Indians had guns and clothes belonging to
the Berry boys, which greatly enraged a brother of the dead men,
who pleaded to be allowed to revenge his kin. After this, no more
Indians were seen on the trip.</p>
<p>In the late summer of 1866, Captain James Andrus<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a> was
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
ordered to investigate Indian routes crossing the Colorado River
in the rough country between the Kaibab and the mouth of the
Green River. A group of men was mustered into service from the
Virgin River settlements at Gould&rsquo;s Ranch, twenty-six miles east
of St. George, August 16, and moved on to Pipe Springs two days
later, where final preparations were made. On the 21st, forty-six
mounted men, each equipped with a rifle and two pistols, and with
a pack horse bearing forty days&rsquo; rations for each pair, started
northeast toward the rough country. They went via abandoned
Kanab and Scutumpah to the Paria River six miles above Paria settlement
where they met another contingent of their party. Two
days later, Joseph Fish with eighteen men arrived from Iron county.
They located the Ute trail which passed down the Paria to the
Colorado. Elijah Averett, sent back with some of the surplus animals,
was killed by Indians in the hills west of Paria.</p>
<p>On August 29, the main party went northeast through the hills
south of the Aquarius Plateau into a valley where they found wild
potatoes growing (hence named Potato Valley, now Escalante
Valley). They climbed the Plateau and looked off into the wild
country stretching to the mouth of the Green River. Convinced
that there was no use in going farther, they retraced their march
on September 2, traveled to the northwest corner of the plateau,
descended to the Sevier River Valley and reached Circleville. They
had been pathbreakers from Paria to this point. From here they
returned via Parowan and Cedar City.</p>
<p>The settlements were now prepared for attack. An Indian raid
was made on John D. Lee&rsquo;s ranch near Beaver on October 23, 1866,
and in November, General Snow learned that the Navajos were
concentrating east of the Colorado for new raids on Kane County.
Soon a friendly Paiute reported that the Navajos were nearing Pipe
Springs.</p>
<p>The crops planted in Long Valley had been left in the care
of friendly Paiutes when the settlers left. In the fall, the Berry
boys and others went back to harvest the best crop that had yet
been grown there. It took several trips to haul the produce to the
Dixie settlements. During their last trip, Snow received a report
of an attack of sixteen Navajos on three white men at Maxwell&rsquo;s
Ranch, in which Enoch Dodge was wounded. Snow sent men to
Long Valley and instructed A. P. Winsor to throw an intercepting
force between the settlements and the fords of the Colorado, to
recover lost stock and find out whether the raiders were Navajos
or Paiutes. He was promised that other men would be held in
readiness if needed.</p>
<p>While this force was on the road, the Long Valley party started
home with a wagon train. On October 31, when the teams were
spread out doubling up Elephant hall, about nine miles south of Mt.
Carmel, Indians attacked near the summit and shot Hyrum Stevens.
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
The pioneers abandoned the train and left everything in the hands
of the Indians. Stevens was taken with the others on horseback
(with a man behind to hold him in place) around the head of Zion
Canyon on a three-day trip over the Old Indian Trail and down
over Kolob to Virgin. He survived the ordeal and returned to his
home at Rockville, where he lived to a ripe old age.</p>
<p>When a rescue party under Captain Sixtus E. Johnson arrived
a week later, November 5, they found the wagons unattended,
tongues broken and contents scattered. The Indians had taken
five yoke of oxen, eleven horses and everything they could carry,
including harness, flour and wheat. Four Paiutes, however, had
pursued the Navajos and recaptured the cattle and harness.</p>
<p>Finding the teamsters gone, Johnson gathered up the livestock
that had scattered back along the way to Long Valley. Then a
second rescue party under Major Russell from Rockville arrived
with the Paiutes who had retrieved the harness and cattle. They
took the caravan into Virgin, arriving November 11.</p>
<p>On November 26, Major John Steele reported signal fires on
the mountain south of Virgin City and General Snow issued an order
to establish posts at the mouth of (Black) Rock Canyon sixteen
miles southeast of St. George and near Gould&rsquo;s Ranch, eight miles
south of Virgin City.<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a> The men at these posts were to serve as
guards as well as herders of livestock and were to build stone quarters;
the &ldquo;house to be covered with stone flagging or earth in a manner
that it cannot be fired from the outside, with but one door and
that heavy and strongly barred, so that one or two men, well armed,
may defend themselves against any number of Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite these precautions, the Navajos scattered in small
bands, easily passed through the military posts, and hid in the
mountains north of St. George. On the evening of December 28,
word reached Harrisburg from local Paiutes that some Navajos
had killed and dried three beeves between Grapevine Springs and
Toquerville. Captain J. D. L. Pearce, with fifteen men from Washington,
at once took up their trail along Harrisburg Creek toward
Pine Valley Mountain but failed to overtake them.</p>
<p>In the meantime, on December 28, near Pine Valley, Cyrus
Hancock saw three Indians skulking on the range and called to
them. The Indians proved hostile and tried to capture him. One
seized his horse&rsquo;s bit and another tried to shoot him with an arrow.
He slid off his horse and ran toward Pine Valley, the Indians in
pursuit. One of them shot him in the arm with an arrow. He
stumbled and fell as they yelled in triumph, but he regained his footing
and outran them into the valley. These Indians were thought
to have been hiding around the town for two or three days, quietly
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
gathering stock. As soon as discovered, they left with about thirty
horses and passed down the Black Ridge between St. George and
Middleton on the night of December 28, gathering more horses at
both places and hastening southwest via Fort Pearce Wash.</p>
<p>Col. D. D. McArthur immediately ordered out all available
cavalry in pursuit of the thieves, who had an entire day&rsquo;s start. An
expedition of thirty men headed by Lt. Copelan followed the Indian
trail from the Washington Fields past Fort Pearce, through Black
Rock Canyon and out toward Pipe Springs where it met another
detachment returning from an Indian encounter.</p>
<p>Captains J. D. L. Pearce and James Andrus were at Harrisburg
on the evening of December 29, when an express carrying instructions
to Colonel Winsor at Rockville arrived. Upon reading
the instructions they started for Rockville and arrived at dawn.
Thirty men gathered and pushed on to Maxwell&rsquo;s ranch where they
arrived that evening. After resting an hour, they hastened on to
Cedar Ridge and five miles southeast of Pipe Springs. Sixtus E.
Johnson spotted the smoke of Indian fires curling up in the distance,
about half a mile from the place where Whitmore and McIntyre
had been killed. The men slipped into a wash and kept out of sight
until within gunshot of the Indians, when they made a dash to get
between them and their horses. Firing opened and the Indians
took to the rocks. The skirmish lasted nearly an hour and covered
a rough area half a mile wide and three miles long. The thirteen
Navajos in the band refused to yield even when cornered, and several
died fighting. During the fray an arrow aimed at Captain
Andrus struck his horse in the forehead, saving the rider. One
mortally wounded Indian continued to shoot until he fainted. Another,
wounded in both legs, fired until his arrows were spent and
then kept twanging his bow as if shooting as long as the fray lasted.</p>
<p>When all was quiet the whites gathered together and found
that none was injured. Two Indians who had escaped came out
on a hill some distance away where they felt safe and slapped their
seats in derision and yelled &ldquo;Squaw! Squaw!&rdquo; in defiance. A man
named Warren, from Pine Valley, who had an extra long range
breechloading gun took a chance shot and brought one of them
down. The other fled.</p>
<p>Of the thirteen Indians, four were killed, seven wounded and
two escaped, only one on horseback. Three horses were lost, but
the balance and the thirteen cattle were recovered and brought
back. Copelan&rsquo;s party returned on January 1, 1867 but Pearce
and Andrus tarried two or three days longer. General Snow was
in Salt Lake City at the time and his responsibility fell largely upon
Captain J. D. L. Pearce and Adjutant Henry Eyring, his assistant.</p>
<p>The concentration in the larger towns and the military control
of the movements of people in the region tended to reduce the
danger to the settlers. Tension with the local Paiute Indians was
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
gradually eased, although the Navajo raids continued for several
years. Jacob Hamblin, Utah&rsquo;s &ldquo;Leatherstocking,&rdquo; played an important
role in quieting the Paiutes. In the fall of 1867, he was
instructed to keep in touch with the Indians and do his best to pacify
them. He went to Kanab, where he helped them plant corn and
vegetables and had peace parleys with them, urging the Paiutes to
cooperate in preventing Navajo raids by watching the fords of the
Colorado and the trails leading to the settlements.</p>
<p>In November, 1868, a band of about thirty Navajos crossed
the river on foot on a marauding expedition. They divided into
squads of two or three and worked at night in different quarters so
rapidly as to baffle the pickets. They got away with some stock,
although twenty-seven horses were recovered from them on the
25th at Black Canyon, by Andrus and his command.</p>
<p>Notice of their presence came on November 22 from Henry
Jennings to Erastus Snow at St. George. The next day local Indians
reported tracks around St. George, and General Snow ordered
the livestock along the Virgin gathered together and herded
under armed guard. He placed pickets along the river for fifteen
miles and sent Col. J. D. L. Pearce with a company of cavalry to
guard the rough country passes from Black Rock Canyon (25 miles
southeast of St. George) to Pipe Springs. Two days later, word
came from Washington that the Navajos had made off with a band
of horses via Black Rock Canyon. On the night of the 26th, a
party of these Indians with about twenty horses eluded the guards
not far from Pipe Springs and made their way eastward. A detachment
under Captain Willis Copelan started in pursuit. He
chased the Navajos and was about to overtake them, but before he
attacked, some friendly Paiutes encountered the Navajos, gave
battle and killed two. They recovered the horses and willingly
turned them over to Copelan on his arrival. The Paiutes were rewarded
with suitable presents.</p>
<p>By December 1, 1868 Pearce concluded that the Navajos had
decamped, and started home, moving from Pipe Springs to Cedar
Ridge. On that same day, however, Erastus Snow received word
from J. W. Young on the Muddy River in Nevada, sixty miles below
St. George, that the Navajos had run off with eighteen horses
and mules. Snow sent word to Pearce to be on his guard. A posse
of whites and Paiutes set out in pursuit from Mesquite. The Indians
overtook the Navajos and recovered eleven of the horses.</p>
<p>The messenger carrying this news reached Col. Pearce at
Cedar Ridge at 4 a.m., December 2, and at daybreak scouts were
sent out. Captain Freeman found their trail and started after them
with several men, being joined by Captain Copelan. They sighted
the Navajos&rsquo; dust, but could not overtake them and the chase had
to be abandoned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>A raid in February 1869 caused such concern that another expedition
(February 25 to March 12) of thirty-six men, under the
leadership of Captain Willis Copelan was sent out to deal with
it.<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a> As usual, the Navajos struck swiftly and fled before the expedition
arrived. At Pipe Springs, Copelan watched the passes,
hunted the surrounding region for the raiders and found they had
gone east. On March 1, with twenty men he started in pursuit
of the raiders. About eight miles out he struck a trail where the
Indians had been driving about fifty head of cattle. During the
next five days he followed the trail around the north end of Buckskin
Mountain (Kaibab) across Paria and Warm Springs Creek
to the old Ute ford on the Colorado River. Finding the quarry
had escaped, he returned home, arriving at St. George March 12.</p>
<p>During the fall, fresh raids by the Navajos created yet another
scare. A band raided settlements north of St. George and drove
off stock. This time Colonel James Andrus was detailed to lead a
foray against the marauders. He started up the Virgin River gathering
fourteen recruits. Then he went to Pipe Springs where he
received word that another band of Navajos had raided near Pinto.
He hastened toward Pinto to intercept them, passing via Kanab
and Scutumpah. Near Paria, he found a trail where some Navajos
had escaped with an estimated eighty head of livestock. Here Andrus
learned that the Paiutes had attacked and wounded a Navajo
in a running fight, and that other raiders were on the way back
from Pinto.</p>
<p>Andrus and his men waited until November 10 and finding no
signs of the Indians, started home. The detachment had not gone
far when they encountered a fresh Navajo trail made by an estimated
twelve horses and two men. They caught up with the Indians
early the next day just as they were passing into a narrow
gorge of the Paria canyon. There were actually eight Indians with
twelve horses, traveling leisurely. Under the detachment&rsquo;s fire,
two Navajos fell; the rest disappeared into the narrows. A few
minutes later they re-appeared on the canyon cliffs on both sides
of Andrus&rsquo; force. Bullets from the Indian rifles soon convinced
Andrus that discretion was the better part of valor and he retired.</p>
<p>The Navajos were adroit raiders. In rounding up stock they
would often camouflage themselves with bush foliage, crawling past
the unsuspecting guards to stampede the herd. Or they would skin
a young steer, leaving hoofs and horns in place and throw the hide
over a brace of Indians, who would steal to the corral under cover
of darkness, let down the bars, and quietly drive the stock away.</p>
<p>These raids were costly. Not only did the settlers live in constant
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
fear, but a heavy toll of livestock, estimated in 1869 at 1200
horses and cattle, was taken. Men had to be continually on the
alert and peaceful pursuits were interrupted to furnish posses to
chase the Indians. When Major J. W. Powell of the U. S. Geological
Survey was exploring the Kanab region in 1870, he expressed
grave concern about the losses the Mormon settlers were
suffering because of the raids.<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a> In October, Jacob Hamblin decided
to accompany Major Powell on a peace mission to the Navajos
when the latter was leaving to return to Washington, DC.<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a>
They reached Fort Defiance in eastern Arizona at a time when
6,000 Navajos were gathered there for their annual allotments
from the Federal government.</p>
<p>All the Navajo chiefs but one were present and met in council
to consider Hamblin&rsquo;s proposal. Powell introduced Hamblin by
saying that he represented the Mormons from the other side of the
Colorado River who were helping to pay the taxes from which the
annual allotments to the Navajos were made. Hamblin, in turn,
pointed to the disastrous consequences of the war and the advantages
of peace. Through war the Navajos had lost twenty or thirty
men; with peace they could herd their livestock in distant places
where forage was good without fear of molestation. He proposed,
in place of war, a peaceful settlement of difficulties and trade with
the Mormons.</p>
<p>After several days of consultation, peace was agreed upon.
The council appointed one of the chiefs, Hastele, who lived near
the Colorado River, as negotiator who ended by saying, &ldquo;We hope
we may be able to eat at one table, be warmed by one fire, smoke
one pipe and sleep under one blanket.&rdquo; Thus was peace promised,
though it was soon again to be put in jeopardy. Hamblin reached
Kanab with the good news about December 11, 1870.<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a></p>
<p>Within a few weeks, a group of eighty Navajos arrived at Kanab
on a trading expedition. They came on foot and brought all
the Navajo blankets they could carry. They scattered among the
settlements and traded their blankets for horses and returned well
satisfied with the experiment.</p>
<p>Peaceful trading continued until the winter of 1873-74, when
a party of four young Navajos was caught in a snowstorm near a
ranch in Grass Valley, Sevier County. They made themselves at
home at the ranch and even killed a small animal for food. The
owner of the ranch, said to be a non-Mormon, learned of their presence
and gathered some of his friends to go with him to investigate.
At the ranch, they shot and killed three of the Indians and
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
wounded the fourth, who escaped and after painful hardships made
his way home.<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a></p>
<p>His story inflamed Navajo vengefulness and disquieting reports
reached the Mormons of threatened reprisals. Brigham
Young asked Hamblin to visit the Navajos again and satisfy them
that the Mormons were not involved in the outrage. Bishop Levi
Stewart of Kanab, however, tried to dissuade Hamblin and even
sent a messenger to induce him to return after he had started, urging
that the risk was too great.</p>
<p>Firm in his purpose, Hamblin went his way and met the Navajos
east of Moencopi, about January 29, 1874. Hastele, the representative
appointed by the Navajos, was not there, but other influential
Indians considered Hamblin&rsquo;s statement. The war council
was held in a Navajo hogan, to which there was but one entrance
opposite Hamblin and his two companions, while two dozen
Navajos occupied the space between.</p>
<p>Hamblin&rsquo;s explanation of the killings was at first rejected
on the ground that it was he who had invited the Navajos to come
into the Mormon country to trade, with the result that three of
their good young men now lay on the ground &ldquo;for the wolves to
eat.&rdquo; The interpreter told Hamblin his companions could go home,
but he must die. The moment was tense. His companions refused
to leave him. Without arousing suspicion, Hamblin passed several
revolvers to his friends, saying as he did so, &ldquo;These are in my
way.&rdquo; The men behind unobtrusively readied them in case of
emergency. Hamblin reminded the Indians of his many friendly
acts, of his willingness to come into their midst to settle the matter,
and told them it was not right to kill him for the acts of strangers
for whom he was not responsible. The wounded Indian was
brought in. A stirring appeal for revenge was made by a young
warrior, who demanded that Hamblin be the victim.</p>
<p>The Indians, however, after the excitement subsided, offered
to settle for three hundred and fifty horses and cattle. Hamblin
deliberately refused. One of them remarked that he would agree
after he had been stretched over the hot coals of the fire. The interpreter
asked if he were not afraid. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my heart
has never known fear. What is there to scare me?&rdquo; &ldquo;The Navajos,&rdquo;
was their answer, to which he replied that he &ldquo;was not afraid
of his friends.&rdquo; Mollified, the Indians finally agreed to leave the
matter to be settled by Hastele after an investigation.</p>
<p>Late that spring, Hastele and his party visited Kanab and were
piloted to Sevier Valley where their findings convinced them that
the Mormons were innocent. Thus ended the last threat to peaceful
relations with the Navajos. Thereafter, both groups traded
on good terms largely due to the outstanding bravery and cool
judgment of Jacob Hamblin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">Expansion in Kane County</span></h2>
<p>Re-settlement of Long Valley and Kanab does not seem to
have been attempted until 1870, although Kanab and Paria were
occupied by missionaries under Jacob Hamblin in 1867 as frontier
outposts. At Paria a strong guard house and corral was built
and some land was cultivated, beginnings out of which the settlement
grew with the accession of several families in 1872 and 1873.</p>
<p>Kanab was similarly restored. The necessity of a fort there
was impressed upon the whites by the continued Navajo raids.
Five stone masons were sent from St. George in 1869 to construct
the fort. They reached Kanab on August 28 and worked until
early in September, when John R. Young told them they had finished
their mission and could go home.</p>
<p>This building expedition brought new settlers to Kanab, for
John Mangum (or Mangram), his brother, James, James Wilkins,
and George Ross, moved there soon after. Nate Adams, who visited
Kanab in September, 1870, and who moved there March 14,
1871, says the first three were in hiding and that John D. Lee,
also in hiding, took up Scutumpah Ranch and explored Lee&rsquo;s
Ferry in 1869. Several missionaries were sent to aid Hamblin
about the same time. They were fencing and cultivating land
when Brigham Young made his first visit to the Kanab country
about the 1st of April, 1870. George Albert Smith wrote of this
visit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At Kanab we met Brothers Jacob Hamblin and
Jehiel MacConnel [McConnell], and several other missionaries,
who were engaged in teaching the Indians
how to cultivate the soil and to obtain a living by peaceful
pursuits. We were much pleased with the country....
As soon as measures shall be taken to prevent the
annual raids of the Navajos, this land of Canaan will
be re-occupied by the Saints and become a valuable
acquisition to our southern settlements.<a class="fn" id="fr_80" href="#fn_80">[80]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A pioneer Salt Lake photographer, C. R. Savage, took many
pictures along the way, including one of Brigham Young and
his party on the Colorado at the mouth of the Virgin, and several
of Zion Canyon.</p>
<p>Upon his return to Salt Lake City on April 16, 1870, Brigham
Young sent a group of fifty-two people led by Levi Stewart, to
re-settle the Kanab country. They went down through the Dixie
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
settlements and reached Pipe Springs on June 1. They remained
there and at Moccasin Springs several days while exploring the
region.<a class="fn" id="fr_81" href="#fn_81">[81]</a> On the 14th they moved over to Kanab Creek and
joined Jacob Hamblin at the old fort, now too small to house so
many.</p>
<p>Brigham Young manifested much interest in the success of
the colony. He promised Stewart that he would visit him in the
fall and asked him to find a more direct route to Kanab from the
north that would obviate the long roundabout approach through
the Dixie settlements and the Arizona strip. Stewart sent out
two expeditions, the second of which found a road from the head
of the Sevier River through Upper Kanab and Johnson Wash.</p>
<p>Brigham Young started for Kanab on August 26, 1870. Accompanying
him from Parowan was the intrepid explorer and
topographer of the U. S. Geological Survey, Major J. W. Powell,
who had already made one trip through the Grand Canyon and
was returning to make plans for further geological studies and
his second trip through the canyon.<a class="fn" id="fr_82" href="#fn_82">[82]</a> In attempting to follow
Stewart&rsquo;s directions, the party lost its way and wandered into the
Paria River valley and thus went many miles out of its direct route.
According to Nate Adams,<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a> &ldquo;old Humpy Indian&rdquo; guided the
company safely into Kanab on the evening of September 9, 1870.
While there, a townsite and fields were surveyed east of the fort
beyond the path of the canyon winds. Brigham Young returned
to Salt Lake City via St. George and the Dixie settlements.</p>
<p>Three months later, on December 14, 1870, six lives were
lost in a fire at the fort. These included Bishop Stewart&rsquo;s wife,
Margery, and three of his sons.<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a> Brigham Young made a special
trip to Kanab from St. George, where he was wintering, to comfort
the bereaved families. Soon after, the settlers began to build
their homes on the townsite. Within a few years, the fort was
deserted but it was maintained for some time for use in case of
emergency. Dellenbaugh, a member of Major J. W. Powell&rsquo;s party,
thus describes his visit to Kanab in the early 70&rsquo;s:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>... Nigger, [a white mule] went along very well and I
was in Kanab by three o&rsquo;clock. The village which had
been started only a year or two, was laid out in the
characteristic Mormon style, with wide streets and regular
lots fenced by wattling willows between stakes.
Irrigating ditches ran down each side of every street
and from them the water, derived from a creek that came
down a canyon back of the town, could be led into any
of the lots, each of which was about one quarter of an
acre; that is, there were four lots to a block. Fruit
trees and vines had been planted and were already beginning
to promise near results, while corn, potatoes,
etc., gave fine crops. The original place of settlement
was a square formed by one-story log houses on three
sides and a stockade on the fourth. This was called the
fort and was a place of refuge though the danger from
Navajo attack seemed to be over and that from any assault
by the Paiutes certainly was past. One corner of
the fort was made by the walls of the schoolhouse, which
was at the same time meeting-house and ball-room. Altogether
there were about 100 families in the village.
The houses that had been built outside the fort were
quite substantially constructed, some of adobe or sun-dried
brick. The entire settlement had a thrifty air, as is
the case with the Mormons. Not a grog-shop, or gambling
saloon, or dance-hall was to be seen; quite in contrast
with the usual disgraceful accompaniments of the
ordinary frontier towns. A perfectly orderly government
existed, headed by a bishop appointed by the church authorities
in Salt Lake City, the then incumbent of this
office being an excellent man, Bishop Stewart.<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the Navajo peace settlement many of the places
abandoned in 1866 were reoccupied and within a few years further
expansion filled most of the remaining areas suitable for
settlements or ranches. In Long Valley, Berryville (now Glendale),
and Winsor (Mt. Carmel) were revived in 1871. Johnson
was settled in the spring of the same year by five brothers, Joel,
Benjamin, Joseph, George and William Johnson, on the site of
Scutumpah, formerly John D. Lee&rsquo;s ranch. In 1872, Graham, on
the headwaters of Kanab Creek (upper Kanab), was reoccupied
and the settlers engaged in dairying and lumbering.</p>
<p>The upper reaches of the Paria, however, attracted settlers
from the north. Panguitch was re-founded in March, 1871 under
George W. Sevy and counted seventy-five families the next
year. Joel H. Johnson and George D. Wilson established a sawmill
in 1871 near the present location of Hillsdale, and were soon
joined by twenty families, including those of Nephi and Seth
Johnson. Other cattlemen located farther up the Sevier, where
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
Meltiar Hatch founded the village bearing his name. Nephi
Johnson, discoverer of Zion Canyon, was made bishop of Hillsdale
in 1874.</p>
<p>Attention was then focused on the upper Paria. The first
settlers, David O. Littlefield and Orley D. Bliss, located near the
present site of Cannonville on Christmas Eve, 1874. Early the
next day eight other families arrived, who built log houses at a
place called Clifton and began farming along the Paria and
on Henrieville Creek. Ebenezer Bryce, from Pine Valley, selected
a place farther upstream, a mile or two east of the present site
of Tropic near the mouth of Bryce Canyon. Bryce used the
famous canyon for a cattle range, and thus immortalized his name.</p>
<p>Clifton was not well located and in 1877 some settlers moved
to a new townsite called Cannonville, in honor of George Q.
Cannon, high Mormon official who had taken a special interest
in their affairs. Other settlers moved over to Henrieville Creek
to be near their farms, and thus the town of Henrieville (named
for James Henrie, president of Panguitch Stake) was born.</p>
<p>In 1879 Daniel Goulding settled near Bryce&rsquo;s ranch. Seeking
water for irrigation, he and Bryce devised a scheme to divert
water from Pine Creek in the Great Basin by means of a canal
over the divide. This they finished, but upkeep was expensive,
their crops were poor, and Goulding lost about five hundred fruit
trees from drouth. Bryce became discouraged and left for Arizona
in 1880 and Goulding moved to Henrieville in 1883. Bryce,
unimpressed by the beauty of the canyon, considered it &ldquo;awful hard
to find a cow that was lost&rdquo; in the intricate maze of its pinnacles.</p>
<p>Seth Johnson and several others located in 1886 on Yellow
Creek (Kane County) about three miles southwest of Cannonville
and named the settlement Georgetown, in honor of the
same man for whom Cannonville was named.</p>
<p>In 1890 the two Ahlstrom brothers built homes on the present
site of Tropic and with several others began a second and more
ambitious attempt to divert water from the East Fork of Sevier
River over the divide into Paria Creek. This time the project
succeeded. Tropic townsite was surveyed in 1891 and settlers
began to flock there and prepare homes and lands in anticipation
of the coming of the water. A fitting celebration was staged on
May 23, 1892, when the water was turned into the canal.</p>
<p>By this time, most of the suitable valleys and canyons had
been occupied. Erosion, however, caused trouble at Kanab.
From 1883 to 1890, floods presumably resulting from overgrazing
tore out dams and ditches and gutted the canyons and valleys
with deep washes. Water arose in the bottom of the washes
and that in Kanab Wash (below Kanab) was diverted about
1886 onto a new townsite just beyond the state line in Arizona,
called Fredonia, which later served as a refuge for a number of
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
polygamous wives during the Federal offensive against
the practice.<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a></p>
<p>While southern Utah was thus growing, a new movement
was developed. In 1879, the Mormon Church leaders called for
eighty men from the Southern Mission to establish an outpost
for the purpose of &ldquo;cultivating and maintaining friendly relations
with Indians whose homes were near the point where the state of
Colorado and the Territories of Utah, New Mexico and Arizona
come together.&rdquo; Twenty-five men, including Kumen Jones, went
out to investigate routes and locations. They traveled via Lee&rsquo;s
Ferry, Tuba City and Monument Valley to the San Juan River
as far as Four-Corners, spent about three months exploring the
region, and then returned home via a northern route, past the
sites of Monticello and Moab.<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a></p>
<p>While they were away, another party set out from Escalante
seeking a short-cut to the San Juan country. A route much more
direct than that mapped by the first party was reported, apparently
on imperfect observation. It was, however, accepted, and
by October the party was on its way. It passed through Escalante
and reached Forty-mile Spring where it was held up by
excessively rough country, while snows in the mountains blocked
retreat.</p>
<p>Three scouts were sent ahead to investigate some of the
wildest and most rugged scenic areas of America. The three
returned in disappointment; one held the route feasible, another
positively rejected it, while the third thought it might be possible
to get through with special help. Envoys were sent to Salt Lake
City to appeal for assistance, which was given in the form of a
legislative appropriation for blasting a way through.</p>
<p>It took fifty days to get eighty-two wagons through Hole-in-the-Rock
and down to the Colorado River and ninety days to
reach Bluff on the San Juan River where the first settlement was
made. Three babies were born on the way and the hardships
endured form a Western epic.<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a></p>
<p>The story of Orderville has been left for the last. The
United Order<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a> was organized at Mt. Carmel, March 20, 1874,
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
by John R. Young, at which time one hundred and nine members
were listed. One summer of the United Order was enough for
most members. Bishop Bryant Jolley, with his numerous family
and relatives, formed the core of the dissenters. To avoid contention,
those who wished to continue with the Order sold their
holdings and moved in a body two miles above Mt. Carmel where
title to all land was vested in the group and where they set up
the town Orderville, under the leadership of Howard O. Spencer.
The new town was surveyed February 20, 1875.</p>
<p>The first building was a hotel where all ate together in the
large dining hall, from July, 1875 to May, 1880. As time passed,
living quarters were provided for each family and work was divided
into more specialized fields.</p>
<p>During the hey-day of the Order, around 1880, it numbered
nearly six hundred adherents and there were some twenty-eight
specialized departments of work which included most of the
various activities that go to make up a simple community. The
Order made great progress and acquired property rapidly. Farming
lands were expanded to include areas scattered through Long
Valley and at Kanab.</p>
<p>The growing power of the Order created jealousies, but disintegration
came from internal dissension. The idea of giving
everyone an equal reward regardless of ability or accomplishment
tended in many cases to lessen effort and brought charges
of laziness and carelessness.</p>
<p>Gradually, more and more individual property was assigned
to each home; farmers were given a share of their own produce
and livestock and sawmills and freighting were operated under
lease or contract. Matters were hastening toward dissolution
when, in 1885, polygamy troubles began. Fear that the Federal
government might confiscate the goods of the Order forced the
final dissolution of most of the property, and farming lands, livestock,
ranches, tannery and sawmill, were all sold to members.
The woolen mill alone was kept and intermittently operated until
1900. In that year the United Order of Orderville was officially
dissolved, twenty-five years after its incorporation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In an instant, there flashed before us a scene never to be
forgotten. In coming time it will, I believe, take rank with a very
small number of spectacles each of which will, in its own way,
be regarded as the most exquisite of its kind which the world
discloses. The scene before us was the Temples and Towers of
the Virgin.&rdquo; Thus prophetically wrote Captain Clarence E.
Dutton of the U. S. Geological Survey in a report published in the
year 1880.</p>
<p>Dutton was following up the geological work begun by
Major J. W. Powell ten or twelve years earlier when the latter
started out to explore the Colorado River and made his two
memorable trips in boats down the river through the Grand
Canyon. The geological problems encountered were so extraordinary
that Dutton was detailed to further investigation and
encountered problems that have engaged the attention of scientists
to this day, particularly the eminent geologist, Dr. Herbert E.
Gregory.</p>
<p>Following the line of Vermillion Cliffs from Kanab westward,
Dutton came to the pass between Eagle Crags and Smithsonian
Butte when suddenly, startlingly, there lay before him to
the northward the valley of the Virgin River in all its grandeur.</p>
<p>Few have seen Zion as Clarence Dutton saw it. From a
high pass, in late afternoon, with the sun on his left, he looked
into that vast panorama of the Vermillion Cliffs of Zion and Parunuweap
and those flanking the Great West Canyon as well&mdash;a
twenty-mile stretch in one sweeping view. The setting sun
cast shadows that made the turrets and towers stand out in bold
relief, while the light reflected from one wall upon another intensified
the tints and shades of the reds until they stood out in
striking contrast with the vivid green of the vegetation and the
higher cliffs. No wonder the cold scientist broke down and described
in emotional terms this superb panorama.</p>
<p>Forerunners of Dutton had visited Zion, but none had
penned such eloquent praise. Major J. W. Powell and two companions,
Stephen V. Jones, one of his topographers, and Joseph
W. Young, a Mormon, left Long Valley on September 10, 1872<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a>
and started down through the Parunuweap on foot. They came
out next day before noon and spent another day visiting Zion
Canyon. Of this trip, Powell says of the Parunuweap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At noon, we are in a canyon 2500 feet deep and we
come to a fall where the walls are broken down, and
the huge rocks beset the channel, on which we obtain
a foothold to reach a level two hundred feet below.
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
Here the canyon is again wider and we find a floodplain
on which we can walk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next day of the Mukuntuweap Canyon, he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Entering this, we have to wade up the stream;
often the water fills the entire channel, and although we
travel many miles, we find no floodplain, talus, or broken
piles of rock at the foot of the cliff. The walls have
smooth, plain faces, and are everywhere very regular
and vertical for a thousand feet or more, where they
seem to break in shelving slopes to higher altitudes; and
everywhere as we go along, we find springs bursting
out at the foot of the walls.<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jack Hillers, a photographer from Powell&rsquo;s party, spent some
time during the summer of 1873 taking pictures in Zion Canyon.
These are on file in the U. S. Geological Survey Office and have
been often used in publications. For a long time, however, this
material and Zion Canyon were largely forgotten. The local
course of development continued placidly for many years. Only
occasionally a hardy traveler, hearing of the beauties of the region,
had courage enough to brave the rocky, dusty roads to enjoy the
scenic splendors. One was Frederick S. Dellenbaugh, who had
accompanied Powell on his second trip down the Grand Canyon.
In the summer of 1903 he found his way into Springdale, where
he made his headquarters with Bishop O. D. Gifford, visited Zion
Canyon, made some oil paintings to be exhibited at the World&rsquo;s
Fair in St. Louis the next year, and wrote an article, &ldquo;A New
Valley of Wonders,&rdquo; which appeared in <i>Scribners&rsquo; Magazine</i>
for January, 1904. In this article, describing his first view of the
West Temple, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One hardly knows just how to think of it. Never
before has such a naked mountain of rock entered our
minds. Without a shred of disguise its transcendent
form rises pre-eminent. There is almost nothing to compare
to it. Niagara has the beauty of energy; the Grand
Canyon of immensity; the Yellowstone of singularity;
the Yosemite of altitude; the ocean of power; this Great
Temple of eternity&mdash;&ldquo;The Titan fronted blowy steeps,
that cradled Time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grafton has a situation that must some day make it
famous, yet one dreads to think of this land being overrun
by the ennuied tourist. But with an altitude of only
3,000 feet, a superb, dry climate, mild winters, magnificent
environment, and a supply of delicious fruits it
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
cannot long remain unvisited if a railway ever is built
within easy reach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Zion pictures at the fair created a great deal of interest.
A young Mormon missionary, David Hirschi, who had been
reared at Rockville and knew every foot of the Zion country,
visited St. Louis on his way home from Europe and found them
to be a center of attraction in the Utah section. He was surprised
and delighted, but was put on his mettle when he heard
skeptics remark that there couldn&rsquo;t be such a place. He informed
them that there certainly was, that he knew its every hill and
cliff, and to prove it, he pointed to his buckskin shoelace and
showed the hill in the picture where he had killed the deer from
which they had been made. A great crowd gathered to listen
and an interesting discussion followed. Undoubtedly the pictures
and magazine article were important factors in arousing
a widespread interest in Zion Canyon. The time was approaching
when its superlative beauty would be recognized by the
national government.</p>
<p>The national conservation program inaugurated by President
Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot produced a bill
(June 8, 1906) empowering the president to set aside certain
lands particularly valuable for scenic, scientific or historic purposes,
as national monuments. Many were created during the
next few years and among them was the Mukuntuweap National
Monument.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1908, Leo A. Snow of St. George, a
United States Deputy Surveyor, was detailed to survey in southern
Utah, Township 40 South, Range 10 West from Salt Lake
City. The party, of which the present writer was a member,
in executing the survey covered the upper part of the Zion gorge.
Triangulation was used in measuring the gorge from the east
to west. When the report and map were submitted that part of
the canyon was described as unsurveyable. In his report, Snow
stated that from a certain place (now Observation Point):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A view can be had of this canyon surpassed only
by a similar view of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado.
At intervals along the west side of the canyon streams
of various sizes rush over the edge of the chasm forming
water falls from 800 to 2000 feet high. The stream
in the bottom of the canyon appears as a silver ribbon
winding its way among the undergrowth and occasionally
disappearing from view. In my opinion this canyon
should be set apart by the government as a national
park.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>The report was dispatched to Washington, June 25, 1909.
A little more than a month later, July 31, the Acting Secretary
of the Interior recommended to the President the creation of the
Mukuntuweap National Monument. President Taft signed the
proclamation on the same day. This act was primarily a withdrawal
from entry&mdash;a method of holding land for national purposes
and preventing it from passing into private ownership.
There was no active administration of the area at first. The
farmers still cultivated the land, the stockmen continued to graze
their cattle in the canyon and the sawmill owners to lower lumber
over the cable. The canyon was still inaccessible to automobiles
and the roadway for wagons or buggies was such that few people
cared to drive over it for pleasure.</p>
<p>Wesley King, of the Salt Lake Commercial Club, was an
early exception. Poor roads could not thwart his desire to see
the scenic beauties of which he had heard from E. D. Woolley,
a prominent leader of Kane County. He and his wife traveled
by train to Marysvale where they obtained a team and buggy
and started south. A report of this trip appeared in <i>The Salt Lake
Tribune</i>, November 12, 1911. King wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We crossed the divide ... and began our descent
into and upon one of the most scenic portions of America....
I do not believe there is anything on the globe
like the canyon of the Rio Virgin, or to compare with
the Vermillion cliffs....</p>
<p>Our admiration for this people was aroused.... They
can only market such products as can be driven
across the mountains, while freighting of goods southward
presents obstacles that would baffle the stoutest
hearts. Here and over in the Dixie Land to the westward,
the people live a simple, healthy life, unspoiled
by the world and its vagaries. Children of the soil ... of
one faith and with a singleness of purpose....</p>
<p>We lost our way and our tempers getting over the
Sahara bordering Kanab. A lone sheep herder saved
us on the second morning out and we floundered into
Kanab over twenty-four hours late, just as Uncle &ldquo;D&rdquo;
Woolley was starting a posse of Indian Scouts after us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kings took Dave Rust for guide and went over to Zion
Canyon. On the brink above Rockville, they &ldquo;hesitated for
awhile in an effort to comprehend the grandeur of the &lsquo;Great
Temple&rsquo; and its score of lesser temples and towers, brilliant in
the glow of the setting sun.&rdquo; King&rsquo;s story continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>We found the Parunuweap Canyon impassable,
so we spent the day in the dark recesses of the Mukuntuweap,
speechless with wonderment, except for an occasional
&ldquo;awe&rdquo; or an &ldquo;absolutely wonderful.&rdquo; This panorama
had a deeper, a more wonderful effect upon us
than anything our eyes had ever beheld....</p>
<p>Garfield, Wayne and Kane counties are sparsely
settled, and until permanent roads are constructed into
them, they will remain so. Washington and Iron counties
have great natural resources and wonderful possibilities
which will blossom into realities only when the
transportation problem has been solved. Each county
can do little by itself in road building. It is a state problem
and must be worked out by our state officials.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Times, however, were rapidly changing. The automobile
was displacing the horse and the demand for good roads for
auto traffic was being met by ever larger road appropriations
by the state and the nation. However, the opening of the scenic
areas of southern Utah and northern Arizona to the touring public
is largely a story of highways.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">The Kaibab and North Rim</span></h2>
<p>North of the Colorado River and south of the Utah line lies
that variegated country known as the Arizona Strip. To the west
lie the Parashont and Trumbull Mountains. To the east, the Kaibab
Plateau, locally known as the Buckskin Mountains, rears its
summit to 10,000 feet in a long level line that stretches southward
to the north rim of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River. Information
concerning this region began to seep in from outposts
during the early 60&rsquo;s. There is little doubt that Whitmore and
McIntyre at Pipe Springs, L. W. Roundy at Kanab, and Peter
Shurtz near Paria, all knew something about its general characteristics,
for it could be observed from all three places.</p>
<p>The expedition led by James Andrus in the spring of 1866 to
rescue Peter Shurtz must have explored the region south of Paria.
Roundy said the expedition started south from Paria to investigate
an Indian smoke and was gone fourteen days (February 23 to
March 9), but no further record is available, except that Nate Adams,
who moved to Kanab in 1871, stated the expedition went over
the Kaibab.</p>
<p>Jacob Hamblin doubtless became well acquainted with the Kaibab
after he went to Kanab in 1867 to live among the Indians. John
D. Lee took up a ranch at Scutumpah (on the Andrus route of 1866)
in 1869, explored the lower Paria, and located the site for a ferry
at its mouth (later Lee&rsquo;s Ferry). Lee and Hamblin must have explored
a good deal of the region together for they built a six room
adobe house with sod roof at Jacob&rsquo;s Lake in north Kaibab
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
soon after. When they divided their property a little later, Lee
took the ferry and Hamblin the pool and Kane Springs in Houserock
Valley.</p>
<p>In 1870, Brigham Young sent a portable steam sawmill to Kanab
and Levi Stewart installed it near Scutumpah and the next year
moved it to Big Springs on the Kaibab. Many years later, it was
moved farther south to Castle or Rigg Springs.</p>
<p>In 1872, Major Powell&rsquo;s party centered its work around the
Kaibab. Part of the time, this party camped near the Levi Stewart
ranch and sawmill.<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a> At that time Eight-Mile Spring, Jacob&rsquo;s Well,
Oak Spring, Pine Spring and Stewart&rsquo;s ranch were all
being used as grazing headquarters. During that summer,
Powell and a friend of his from Illinois, Professor Harvey C. DeMotte,
explored the roof of the Kaibab and bestowed the name
DeMotte Park upon the main valley (sometimes called V T Park).
In 1873, Thomas Moran, the well-known Western artist who had
been commissioned by the Federal government to paint the Grand
Canyon, made a trip by mule team from Salt Lake City to the Kaibab,
where Major Powell suggested the vantage from which he
produced the canvas of the Grand Canyon now hanging in the National
Capitol.</p>
<p>The use of the Kaibab for grazing gradually increased. In
1877 the United Order of Orderville acquired most of the holdings
on the northern Kaibab and controlled the range for about ten years,
after which time lands and stock passed into private ownership.</p>
<p>During the late 80&rsquo;s, John W. Young (son of the Mormon
leader), representing the Mormon Church in England, conceived
a grandiose scheme for interesting English aristocracy in the Kaibab
as a private recreation area. He acquired the major holdings there
and stocked it with cattle and horses. Dan Seegmiller of Kanab
was placed in charge of operations. Young&rsquo;s scheme fell through,
but he was not discouraged. He enlarged his plan for making the
Kaibab a great hunting ground and center of tourist travel with hotels
and lodges for the English nobility. Some interest was shown,
and several British sportsmen decided to investigate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buffalo Bill&rdquo; Cody was in England at the time with his wild
west show, and was anxious to dispose of his animals there and
recruit his stock in the United States. Young induced him to
replenish in the Kaibab and to act as guide for the English representatives.
Junius Wells went as Young&rsquo;s agent. The trip was
made in the summer of 1891. Dan Seegmiller took wagons to Flagstaff,
Arizona, on the railroad, to meet Buffalo Bill and the Englishmen.
He had with him Bill Crosby, Nate and Orza Adams and
Brig Young (son of John W. Young). They returned via Lee&rsquo;s
Ferry to Houserock Valley and the Kaibab.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>The party included Junius Wells, Buffalo Bill and his crack
rifle-shot, John Baker and the Englishmen, Major McKinnon, Lord
Ingram and Lord Milmey. They were entertained by the local
cattlemen, including Anthony W. Ivins, E. D. Woolley, Ed Lamb,
Jr., Walter Hamblin, Alex Cram, Ebenezer Brown and Al Huntington.
The British agents, however, decided the Kaibab was too
far away and too hard to reach. The party went out through
Kanab where the presence of English lords and Buffalo Bill proved
almost too much for the inhabitants.</p>
<p>The failure of the deal left John W. Young in difficulties. To
clear the situation, the Kaibab Land and Cattle Company was organized
and money borrowed from New York bankers. A little
later, Cannon, Grant and Company of Salt Lake City took over the
mortgage and Anthony W. Ivins became field manager. By skillful
husbandry, Ivins redeemed the mortgage and tax sale. In 1896
he moved to Mexico and the Kaibab holdings and property were
sold to Murdock and Fotheringham of Beaver, who soon sold out
to the B. F. Saunders cattle outfit. He in turn, later sold to the
Grand Canyon Cattle Company (E. J. Marshall Co.), still in control
at the time the Kaibab National Forest was established (1908).
It had been set aside as a national forest reserve in 1893.</p>
<p>Dan Seegmiller&rsquo;s close association with the Kaibab and North
Rim impressed him with its outstanding importance as a national
vacation-land, a view shared by many. He continued, as long as
he lived, to advertise its merits. About 1896, three years before
his death, he drove a white top buggy from Kanab to Milford,
picked up a New York party and escorted it over the Kaibab to the
North Rim and back. After his partner&rsquo;s death, E. D. Woolley began
taking parties into the Kaibab and North Rim. He was the
most prominent man of the Kanab region and logically the one to
take the lead in its development from the north side of the Colorado
River.</p>
<p>Despite his zealous interest, difficulties of transportation, poor
roads, distance from the railroad, slow method of travel, all conspired
to prevent significant development. Woolley finally conceived
the idea of making a trail from the South Rim (rail terminal)
across the Grand Canyon via Bright Angel Creek. For this purpose,
he organized the Grand Canyon Transportation Company.
The members included himself, T. C. Hoyt, Thomas Chamberlain,
Jim Emett, E. S. Clark, and later (1906) D. D. Rust. A permit
was obtained from Arizona to construct a toll trail across the canyon.
Governmental regulations forebade tolls, however, and they
had to limit their revenue to charges for transportation and guide
services.</p>
<p>E. D. Woolley and Jim Emett began the trail in 1901. It proved
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
an expensive undertaking and in 1908 Jesse Knight invested $5,000
to help it along. A cable car was installed for crossing the river.
The car was suspended from the cable track by pulleys and pulled
back and forth by a propeller cable wound on drums. This route
proved to be an important inlet to the North Rim and Kaibab. The
total traffic, however, was relatively small and remained so until
better transportation facilities became available.</p>
<p>One of the chief events of those days was an expedition engineered
by E. D. Woolley in September, 1905, in which a party consisting
of Senator Reed Smoot, T. C. Hoyt, E. D. Woolley, E. G.
Woolley (nephew), Graham McDonald, James Clove, Lewis T.
Cannon and Congressman Joseph Howell traveled leisurely by
team from Salt Lake City through the state, holding political rallies
as they went. At Kanab (September 26), schools were dismissed
and a gala holiday declared. The expedition moved on to the Kaibab
and North Rim where the distinguished visitors enjoyed the
scenery and hunted deer on Greenland Peninsula. The trip provided
conspicuous advertising for the Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>On November 28, 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt established
the Grand Canyon National Game Preserve and thereafter
deer were protected and predatory animals hunted. Government
hunters of the U. S. Biological survey were employed for that purpose
from 1906 to 1923. During that period, more than eight hundred
cougars, thirty wolves, nearly five thousand coyotes and more
than five hundred bobcats were removed.</p>
<p>One of the interesting characters among these hunters was
&ldquo;Uncle&rdquo; Jim Owen, who with his hounds took about six hundred
cougars from the Kaibab and one hundred and thirty from regions
to the north and west. He had previously been a member of the
Jesse James gang and when intoxicated was a man to be avoided.
At El Tovar, one night, he took a dislike to the clerk, tried to shoot
him, and filled the room so full of holes it cost the party $100 to
settle the damages.</p>
<p>D. D. Rust was a school teacher at Fredonia during the winter
of 1905-6. During the following summer, he joined the Grand
Canyon Transportation Company and was employed for many
years thereafter as a guide for tourist parties. Zane Grey, the famous
Western novelist, came in April, 1907, and Rust took him over
to the North Rim to hunt mountain lions (cougars). Zane was
then a tenderfoot who slept with a six-shooter under his pillow, a
practice he abandoned as he became hardened. He returned later
in the season to hunt with Col. C. J. Jones (Buffalo Jones), Grant
Wallace, a journalist, and Jim Emett, local cattleman. On this
hunt, Wallace captured alive the big king lion of Bright Angel
Canyon. Incidentally, Zane Grey built his novel <i>The Heritage of
the Desert</i> around Emett&rsquo;s trial at Flagstaff in April, 1907. Emett,
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
whose headquarters were at Lee&rsquo;s Ferry, had been accused of rustling
by the B. F. Saunders&rsquo; outfit.</p>
<p>On January 11, 1908, the President issued a proclamation
creating the Grand Canyon National Monument and separating it
from the Kaibab National Forest. During the summer of 1908,
Rust took Nathan Galloway, a trapper from the Uintah Basin,
from whom he had learned the Canadian method of shooting rapids,
into the Markagunt Plateau to hunt grizzly bears.</p>
<p>Buffalo Jones came back again in early August, 1909, with a
party of Bostonians to hunt cougars with Jim Owen. After five
days, Buffalo Jones bagged a live lion to take home with him. On
that day, the hounds struck another cougar trail and led the party
backward six or seven miles until the trail got cold. Then it was
discovered that &ldquo;Old Pot,&rdquo; the reliable hound, was missing. They
retraced their trail and found him with a &ldquo;treed&rdquo; cougar about a
half mile in the opposite direction from where they had started.
Buffalo Jones went up the tree with a rope and a stick. The lion
saw Jones coming and started down the tree toward him. Jones
backed down slowly and stopped. The cougar stopped, too, glared
at the man and backed up on his limb. Jones crept slowly up again
until he could reach the cougar with his stick and poked a noose
over the lion&rsquo;s head. When the rope was pulled, the beast jumped
the wrong way and crashed through the limbs chewing at the rope.
On the ground the dogs pounced on him and Jones roped the hind
legs while others manned the rope around the neck. They stretched
him out, tied him alive on the back of a burro, and carried him
across the Grand Canyon to the railroad. Motion pictures of this
hunt were taken by Jones.</p>
<p>It was in June, 1909, that the first automobiles were driven
through the Kaibab to the North Rim. This was a stunt engineered
by Edwin Gordon Woolley, Jr., of Salt Lake City. With his wife
and brother-in-law, D. A. Affleck, he took two autos, a Locomobile
and Thomas Flyer, and arrived at Kanab on the fifth day. Here
they were joined by E. D. Woolley and Graham McDonald from
Kane County. It took three days more to reach the North Rim at
Bright Angel. At the time this was a real feat. Gasoline had been
distributed in advance by team, ten gallons every thirty miles. They
carried with them tools and equipment for car repairs and road
making, as well as canvas for use in sand and extra water for overheated
engines. They had to remove high road centers, fill up
washes, level off sideling dugways and cut timber falls out of the
wagon roads. Indians came to Kaibab from miles around to see
their first &ldquo;devil wagons,&rdquo; which they were loath to believe could
run. At the end of the trip, it was found that nine new tires valued
at $80 each had been worn out. These were exhibited by the US.
Rubber Company to demonstrate the wonderful performance of
their product.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>The advent of automobiles on the Kaibab and North Rim
opened up new vistas of development. Woolley began to envision
the time when the construction of good roads would permit
easy access to visitors and when the scenic features of the Grand
Canyon and the deer herds of the Kaibab would attract attention
and induce many to come. His vision was to be realized before
many years had passed.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">Modern Development of Zion, Bryce and North Rim</span></h2>
<p>At the beginning of the second decade of the 20th century,
a few individuals here and there in the state were beginning to grasp
the potentialities of southern Utah as a scenic mecca. Throughout
the United States, agitation for better roads gained ground as
the automobile assumed a larger place in our national consciousness.
The first transcontinental auto trip was made about 1900
and much difficulty was experienced in finding passable routes.
The old pioneer wagon roads, disused since the completion of the
transcontinental railroad in 1869, had fallen into disrepair and
were obliterated or washed by erosion in many of the desert and
mountainous areas so that they were often forgotten and nearly
impassable.</p>
<p>After the first trip, however, other autoists quickly followed
and there was a loud demand for logs and guide materials during
the next decade&mdash;a demand which leading Utah newspapers
attempted to supply. The first quarter of the century may be
characterized as transitional from wagon and train to automobile.
Roads had to be redesigned on the basis of alignment instead
of grade control and reconstructed into highways, destined to become
not only supplemental feeders of railroads but also competitors.</p>
<p>This movement led to the establishment in 1909 of the Utah
State Road Commission, empowered to develop state roads and
with the avowed intention to build a two million dollar highway
through the entire state from Logan to St. George. It took several
years for this program to reach southern Utah and by that time
road building was beginning to be affected by modern methods
of highway construction.</p>
<p>Occasional trips into the scenic southland continued, some
primarily for enjoyment, others for publicity or promotional purposes,
all of which served to focus public attention more and
more on the area. Public pressure was brought to bear not only on
the road commission, but also on the governor and eventually
on the Federal government.</p>
<p>Governor William Spry of Utah (1908-1916) made at least
three trips into the region (1912, 1913, 1916). During September,
1912, he visited the Dixie Fruit Festival at St. George, then
went to Kanab and northward through the State prospecting the
route now followed by highway 89.</p>

<p>During the following winter, a group of convicts from the
Utah State Penitentiary was put to work building roads in Washington
County between Cedar City and Toquerville. They improved
the bad roads of the time, but the route was poorly chosen
and was replaced several years later by a well-planned highway.
The convicts continued to be employed in Washington
County for several winters.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1913, E. D. Woolley and others urged
the State Road Commission to take over the task of building an
auto road southward from Salina to the state line on the route
to North Rim. That fall, the U. S. Forest Service started construction
of a permanent boulevard (?) from Jacob&rsquo;s Lake to North
Rim with a total allotment of $2750! The result was a road which
when compared with highways of today, illustrates the revolutionary
changes in standards of road making.</p>
<p>In July and August, 1913, ex-President Theodore Roosevelt
took a party into the Kaibab from South Rim and spent three
weeks hunting lions. They captured three and took one alive
across the canyon. Roosevelt reported the trip in an article in
the <i>Outlook</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a></p>
<p>During that same summer, J. Cecil Alter, director of the U. S.
Weather Bureau at Salt Lake City and editor of this Quarterly,
made a leisurely trip southward with his wife and two companions
in a white top spring wagon, via Marysvale, Panguitch,
Kanab and Jacob&rsquo;s Lake to the Kaibab, North Rim and over the
Cable Crossing to El Tovar. Returning, he traveled via Ryan,
Pipe Springs and Rockville to Zion, then out via Toquerville,
Parowan, Circleville and Marysvale. He reported the interesting
aspects of his trip in <i>The Salt Lake Tribune</i> on August
31, 1913, and January 4, 1914. The enthusiasm of the <i>Tribune</i>
was aroused and the paper sponsored a &ldquo;pathfinder&rdquo; tour under
the leadership of W. D. Rishel to log the road to Grand Canyon.
It left Salt Lake City on September 6, visited the canyon and paused
a day at Kanab on the return trip.</p>
<p>On the occasion of Governor Spry&rsquo;s first visit to Zion in
October, 1913, the people along the Virgin River declared a holiday
and accompanied his party almost en masse into Zion, where
a picnic was enjoyed at the foot of the cable. To thrill the governor,
a man was lifted to the top of the cliffs on the cable and
brought back a few minutes later. The party rode horseback
into the Narrows and was much impressed by the experience.
Governor Spry was thoroughly convinced of the importance of
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
national recognition and thereafter earnestly pressed for its
realization.</p>
<p>From Rockville, the party took spring buggies for Kanab
with extra teams to negotiate the hills. The idea behind the trip
seems to have been to investigate the possibilities of tourist travel
from some point on the Salt Lake Route Railroad to Zion and
Grand Canyon. Douglas White, writing in <i>The Arrowhead</i> for
July 1917, said that as a result of this visit, Governor Spry &ldquo;decided
that the highway division of his administration should accomplish
the construction of a highway to the border of the National
Monument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By 1914, the local people of Dixie no less than the governor,
were awakening to the scenic potentialities of their homeland.
It had taken five years to sell the idea of Zion Canyon as a national
mecca to the people living near it. The Grand Canyon Highway
Association was organized with David Hirschi as president,
and a five-county (Washington, Kane, Iron, and Beaver in Utah
and Coconino in Arizona) road convention was called for July
in Hurricane. Up to this time no auto had yet been driven from
Toquerville to Zion Canyon.</p>
<p>The first problem was to make the roads passable by removing
high centers, reducing grades and filling washes. A campaign
was launched locally to secure subscriptions for road improvement.
Hurricane pledged $2,000, La Verkin $500, Toquerville
$1,500 and Cedar City $1,200. During the winter the road
from Toquerville to Hurricane and the dugway up the Hurricane
Fault to the east toward Kanab were improved.</p>
<p>In 1916, political pressure had reached Washington. Senator
Reed Smoot responded and planned to ask for federal assistance
in road making. This dovetailed with a national movement
which culminated that year in the first federal aid road act. Smoot
called upon the Department of the Interior for information concerning
the Mukuntuweap National Monument. Horace M. Albright,
a youthful assistant to Secretary Franklin K. Lane, furnished
the data. Senator Smoot inserted in a deficiency appropriation
an item reading as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For a proportionate share of the amount required
to construct an inter-state wagon road or highway
through the Mukuntuweap National Monument, Utah,
approximately fifteen miles for the fiscal year 1917,
$15,000. [Approved September 8, 1916. 39 Stat. 801-818].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The U. S. National Park Service was authorized by Congressional
Act of August 25, 1916, but it was not actually established
until May, 1917. Ever since the passage of the National
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
Monument Act of June 8, 1906, national monuments had been
accumulating without adequate supervision. The need for an
agency to handle national parks and national monuments was
becoming urgent. The bill, as passed, created the National Park
Service &ldquo;To promote and regulate the use of the Federal Areas
known as National Parks, Monuments and Reservations by such
means and measures as conform to the fundamental purposes
of said parks, monuments and reservations, which purpose is to
conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the
wild life therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same
in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired
for the enjoyment of future generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Albright had joined Secretary Lane&rsquo;s staff in 1913 and had
been assigned to deal with the parks and monuments. When
the National Park Service was established, Stephen T. Mather
of California was appointed director, April 19, 1917 and Albright
was named his assistant. Because of illness, Mather did not
assume his duties until March, 1918. and Albright served as acting
director.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <i>The Salt Lake Tribune</i> had sent another
auto pathfinding tour led by W. D. Rishel to the Grand Canyon,
starting August 6, 1916. It reached Kanab in two days and spent
three more going to North Rim and back to Kanab. From here,
it headed for Hurricane and Zion. At Pipe Springs, the cavalcade
met a railroad party in a large White bus going to North Rim
(August 13). This party included representatives of the Union
Pacific and the Oregon Short Line railroads, together with those
of other travel agencies. The expedition shortly preceded the
consolidation of the two railway systems represented, and the
agents were scouting the possibilities for railroad traffic in the
region. They had left the railroad at Lund by bus and traveled
via Hurricane to Pipe Springs where they met Rishel&rsquo;s jaded
eight-car cavalcade.</p>
<p>The next day they drove through the Kaibab to Bright Angel
Point on the North Rim; spent the following day sight-seeing
and then drove back to Kanab, Hurricane and Rockville (August
16), where they held a meeting in the evening. The youngsters
of Rockville saw their first auto bus and many of them had a ride.
As on Governor Spry&rsquo;s first visit to Rockville (October 12, 1913),
the local people took a holiday and many accompanied the party
next day into Zion Canyon. After visiting in the canyon until
noon, the party drove to St. George where they enjoyed a feast
of Dixie fruit. The next day they held a meeting in Cedar City
and then returned to the railroad at Lund.</p>
<p>D. S. Spencer, Union Pacific Railroad Passenger Agent, informed
the writer that the trip had been sponsored by the railroads
and that Governor Spry and Road Commissioner Lunt had
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
been induced to go along for consultation on road development.
Governor Spry promised all possible support if the railroads would
undertake tourist traffic development. Spencer further explained
that the Union Pacific had profited from the experience of Edward
H. Harriman, the noted railroad capitalist, who had built a spur
to West Yellowstone, thereby greatly increasing his long-haul
traffic to San Francisco. Carl R. Gray, Harriman&rsquo;s successor as
president of the Union Pacific, recognized similar possibilities in
tourist traffic to Zion and Grand Canyon.</p>
<p>Sometime that fall, Douglas White designated the route
from Los Angeles to Salt Lake via Las Vegas, St. George and
Cedar City, now generally traversed by Highway 91, as the
Arrowhead Route. The next year, Charles H. Bigelow of Los
Angeles, was instrumental in organizing the Arrowhead Trail
Association with J. H. Manderfield of Salt Lake City as president,
and Joseph S. Snow of St. George, vice-president. It functioned
for many years to promote road development.</p>
<p>Frederick Vining Fisher, a Methodist minister of Ogden,
Utah, came to Salt Lake City in 1915 to lecture and show slides of
California to advertise the Panama Pacific International Exposition.
He had ministered in Ogden for some years prior to 1912,
but his attention had never been called to Zion Canyon. One day
at lunch at the University of Utah, a student said to him, &ldquo;Mr.
Fisher, your pictures last night were fine, but you have not seen the
best.&rdquo; Surprised, Fisher then wormed the story of Zion Canyon
out of the lad. He was at once eager to visit the canyon, and in
September, 1916, while traveling to St. George with Apostle
Anthony W. Ivins, of the Latter-day Saints Church, to attend a
local conference, visited the scenic area, took pictures and made
slides which he thereafter used in lectures throughout the country.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Fisher induced Warren Cox, hotel proprietor
of St. George, to take him to the Grand Canyon at the lower end
of Toroweap Valley, Mt. Trumbull, where he took interesting
pictures. Then, as Fisher recalls, Cox dared him &ldquo;to cross the
untrod wilderness one hundred miles&rdquo; to Kaibab and North Rim.
After they had explored the Kaibab with its endless herds, they
camped with Jim Owens, U. S. Government hunter, for three
days, vacationing and taking pictures. From North Rim, they
went to Cedar City where they met Ivins, who in the meantime
had obtained a team from his Enterprise ranch and who took Fisher
up Cedar Canyon to Cedar Breaks where more pictures were
taken. Upon returning to Cedar City, Cox accompanied Fisher to
Rockville where he left him.</p>
<p>Bishop David Hirschi&rsquo;s son, Claud, took Fisher and a friend,
Bingham, up Zion Canyon where Fisher got the greatest thrill
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
of his life. They decided to name the scenic points as they went
along. Three peaks that Hirschi thought looked like Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob, they called the <i>Three Patriarchs</i>. The boys of
the party stopped at the big loop in the river and looked at the
pillars of rock on the inside point. When Fisher asked why they
were delaying the boys replied they were waiting for an organist
to play the <i>Great Organ</i>. They coined several other names not
now in use, but after reaching the Narrows and starting back,
Hirschi espied a great white precipice gleaming in the afternoon
sun, framed by the pass between Angels Landing and the Great
Organ. He said. &ldquo;Oh, Doctor, look quick, what is that?&rdquo; Overwhelmed,
Fisher replied, &ldquo;Never have I seen such a sight before.
It is by all odds America&rsquo;s masterpiece. Boys, I have looked for
this mountain all my life but I never expected to find it in this
world. This mountain is the Great White Throne.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a></p>
<p>The money appropriated September 8, 1916, for a wagon
road in Zion had to be spent before July 1, 1917. An engineer,
W. O. Tufts, was dispatched from Washington, D.C. to look
into the matter. After preliminary exploration, a survey was
made, plans outlined, material procured and workmen engaged.
By November 1, construction on the road was begun, starting at
the boundary and working up the canyon. About the same time,
convicts were building a road from La Verkin to Springdale.
By the summer of 1917, a passable road led into Zion Canyon.</p>
<p>Douglas White, zealous promoter of Utah&rsquo;s scenic riches,
urged Albright to come west and visit Zion Canyon with him in
the summer of 1917. In September, he met him in Los Angeles and
they went to Lund, Utah, by train and over to Cedar City by
auto, where they met Road Commissioner Henry W. Lunt and
Mr. R. A. Thorley, a Cedar City stockman. The next morning
Albright, White and Thorley, in a touring car driven by Chauncey
Parry, started south over the &ldquo;perfectly terrible roads&rdquo; and
reached the Wylie Camp in Zion in the afternoon. At Rockville,
they met David Hirschi, bishop of the village. The next day,
in the words of Albright:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We went as far up Mukuntuweap Canyon as possible.
We watched the cable operate from the rim of
Zion to the floor. We hiked through to the Narrows
and back again. That night we saw a full moon light
up the canyon and the next morning I was up early
enough to see the sunlight creep down from the top of
the domes and spires to the valley floor. I was
overwhelmed by the loveliness of the valley and the
beauty of the canyon walls and was sure that the area
was of national park caliber.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>Albright faced two troublesome local problems: elimination
of grazing in the canyon and keeping narrow-tired wagons off
the new road. He conferred with Bishop Hirschi, who suggested
a conference with the local people concerned. At the conference,
Albright recorded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... cooperation of the local people was cheerfully extended,
and the orders were issued soon after and were
generally obeyed, with the result that the grazing
was stopped and the shrubs and wild flowers in the
canyon began to come back. I shall always remember
with keenest delight my early association with those
good Mormon people, who, without knowing what a
national park was, cooperated so fully in executing
orders that brought them real hardship.<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the contractors finished the Zion road, equipment and
other government property was left in care of Walter Ruesch
of Springdale, whose home had been used as headquarters by
Tufts. Albright interviewed Ruesch and retained him in charge.
This led to Ruesch&rsquo;s appointment as first custodian of the Monument
and later as first acting superintendent of the Park. Albright
enjoyed recounting his first introduction to Ruesch by Bishop
Hirschi, who told him &ldquo;what a fine character Mr. Ruesch was
and how hard he worked, but cautioned me that he had one terrible
habit. Over and over again he emphasized the habit. Finally,
almost terror-stricken, I asked him what the bad habit was,
and he said, &lsquo;He swears.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Horace Albright and Douglas White left Zion, they
called upon the new Governor (Simon Bamberger), whom they
asked to continue the convict labor on the road from Cedar City to
Zion. The story goes that the Governor had driven over this road
and found it pretty rough. Besides, the dugway up the Hurricane
Fault had cost much more than he had expected. The proposals
of White and Albright aroused his wrath. Jumping to his feet,
the Governor pounded his desk and shouted, &ldquo;I build no more
roads to rocks!&rdquo; As a matter of fact, road improvement was
interrupted for the time being; World War I was on and interest
lagged, not to be revived until 1920, when it was nearly time for
a new governor to take over the state administration.</p>
<p>From Salt Lake City Albright wired Director Mather, who
was still in California and had not yet assumed office, urging
him to visit southern Utah, and giving him a glowing account of
what he had seen. Mather did not reply at once but later wrote
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
that he thought Albright must have fallen into the hands of some
chamber of commerce directors or had been given some very
potent drink, for he had never heard of such a country and found
it difficult to believe it existed.</p>
<p>During the next winter in Washington, D.C., Albright toyed
with the idea of changing the name of the monument from Mukuntuweap
to Zion and was urged to do so by Douglas White.
Secretary Lane approved and the Utah congressional delegation
concurred. Albright prepared a proclamation changing the name
and enlarging the monument to one hundred and twenty square
miles, which President Wilson signed March 18, 1918.</p>
<p>Other Utah scenic areas, including Cedar Breaks, Bryce
Canyon and Wayne Wonderland, all profited by the publicity
accorded Zion and the Grand Canyon. S. A. Halterman of
Parowan, Utah, took the first automobile to Cedar Breaks via
the wagon road in Parowan Canyon. In 1920, he piloted Senator
Smoot and others over the same route to see the Breaks. By
1921, he was planning regular weekly trips for tourists during
the summer. Iron County spent about $12,000 that year to improve
the road.</p>
<p>On August 25, 1918, Oliver J. Grimes of Salt Lake City, published
an article in <i>The Salt Lake Tribune</i>, describing &ldquo;Utah&rsquo;s
New Wonderland, Bryce&rsquo;s Canyon,&rdquo; which stimulated additional
interest in southern Utah&rsquo;s scenic wonderland. During that summer,
LeRoy Jeffers, an eastern writer, visited Bryce Canyon and
published an article entitled, &ldquo;The Temple of the Gods in Utah&rdquo;
in the <i>Scientific American</i> of October 5, 1918. He approached
Bryce from North Rim of Grand Canyon, from which he says,
&ldquo;we made a rapid run through the yellow pine and aspen forest
of the Kaibab Plateau&mdash;crossed the burning sands of the Kanab
which nestles verdantly among the vermillion cliffs of southern
Utah. We had come eighty to eighty-five miles before sundown
and were ready for a similar trip to Panguitch on the following
day.&rdquo; He gave directions for reaching Bryce via Marysvale and
Panguitch; described the wonders of the scenery and published
four pictures.</p>
<p>When Albright read the article, he recalled that he had
heard of Bryce Canyon when he was at Zion and made inquiries
about the feasibility of establishing it as a national monument.
He was temporarily blocked because it was a part of a national
forest. However, it was placed on the agenda for later consideration.
Albright later made up his mind that Bryce Canyon belonged
in the National Park System, but Director Mather did not
at first agree and toyed with the idea of a system of state parks to
supplement the national system. Bryce, he considered, would make
a keystone around which other state parks could be clustered. However,
when the Utah governor and state legislature rejected his
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
view and insisted that Bryce Canyon, Cedar Breaks and Wayne
Wonderland were of national park caliber, he yielded and when
later he saw these marvels, was delighted that he had done so.</p>
<p>Cedar City was preparing to cope with the growing traffic.
It was apparent that the town was the strategic point for those
wishing to visit southern Utah via the railroad and auxiliary bus
lines. Randall L. Jones returned to his native Cedar City in 1912
as an architect, and drew plans for a modern hotel, later called
El Escalante. The local chamber of commerce backed him and
work was started in 1918. It was, however, a major undertaking
for a small community and was not completed for several years.
His wide travel experience and his realization of the necessity of
good highways as well as good hotels in the development of scenic
attractions, made him the logical choice at a later date as liaison
officer for the Union Pacific Railroad.</p>
<p>Mather and Albright were both in the West during the
summer of 1919, but neither had opportunity to visit southern
Utah. However, Albright had conferred with Senator Smoot
several times on the question of creating Zion Canyon a national
park. Mather finally yielded to their persuasion even though he
had not yet seen it. Albright went ahead with plans, drafted
legislation, prepared reports and presented arguments to the
congressional committees. Boundary lines of the park were based
upon information furnished by Richard A. Thorley of Cedar City
and Leo A. Snow of St. George.</p>
<p>Smoot had previously introduced a bill in the Senate (S. B.
8282) to change the name of Mukuntuweap National Monument
to Little Zion National Park, but no action was taken. On May
20, 1919, he introduced another bill (S. B. 425, Vol. 58:9640) to
establish the Zion National Park in the State of Utah. It passed
the Senate a month later and was sent to the House Committee
on Public Lands the next day. It was reported in the House,
August 26, after which amendments delayed its passage until
October 6. The bill was finally signed in the House, November
15, and in the Senate, November 19, 1919, and sent to the President,
who signed it that same day.</p>
<p>Mather was in Denver at the time of its passage, attending a
conference of national park superintendents, at which Walter
Ruesch was also present as custodian of Zion National Monument.
When word reached him, Mather immediately decided to
make his long delayed visit to Zion. His enthusiasm was immediate
and thereafter he gave personal attention to its affairs.</p>
<p>The dedication took place, September 15, 1920, in the presence
of a large assembly. St. George and Cedar City bands furnished
music. Speakers included Director Mather, Senator Reed
Smoot, ex-Governor William Spry, C. Clarence Neslen, mayor
of Salt Lake City, and Heber J. Grant, president of the Mormon
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
Church, representing Governor Simon Bamberger. Mather reviewed
the history of the Park, Mayor Neslen foretold its future,
and other speakers promised support for its development.</p>
<p>Travel into Zion was slowly increasing. The number of people
entering in 1920 nearly doubled that of the previous year
(from 1914 to 3692). By 1930 it had increased to more than
55,000 and for a decade thereafter registered proportionate gains.
Governor Bamberger in 1920 sent Randall Jones to Denver as
Utah&rsquo;s delegate to the Park-to-Park Highway conference, where
plans were laid to coordinate the local movements for good roads
into a park-to park system.</p>
<p>Among the interesting parties that came in 1921 was a tour
sponsored by the <i>Brooklyn Eagle</i>, which took in the scenic loop
to Bryce Canyon as a side trip. Mather came again, bringing
with him Emerson Hough, eminent novelist, and Edmund Heller,
naturalist. During that year a road passable for autos was built
from Cedar City up Cedar Canyon to the Breaks, but it was
excessively steep and dangerous.</p>
<p>In response to pressure from Utah to undertake development
of the scenic south, in 1921 Carl R. Gray, president of the Union
Pacific Railroad Company, determined to investigate personally
the agricultural possibilities of contributing areas. His party left
Lund and examined the farming areas around Cedar, Parowan
and Fillmore and interviewed farmers and livestock men. Mr.
Gray was favorably impressed with the stability of the communities
and the quality of the people. As a result, a railroad spur
was built to Fillmore a year later.</p>
<p>The following summer Gray and his party made the rounds
of the scenic areas. The Union Pacific was preparing to take
over the Salt Lake Route and was further investigating the resources
of the area. According to Randall Jones, Gray offered
to buy the El Escalante Hotel in Cedar City and the next year a
spur of the railroad was run from Lund to Cedar City, justified
on the basis of anticipated traffic from livestock, agriculture,
iron ore and tourist travel.</p>
<p>With a rail-head at Cedar City, June 27, 1923, the Union
Pacific organized a subsidiary Utah Parks Company, took over
the El Escalante Hotel, set up a large bus station at Cedar City,
purchased the Wylie tourist camp interests in Zion Canyon and
the Parry transportation route from Cedar City to Zion. In 1917
under National Park permit to the National Park Transportation
and Camping Company, W. W. Wylie, who formerly operated in
Yellowstone Park, had set up a tent camp in Zion Canyon and North
Rim in cooperation with two of the Parry Brothers, Gronway
and Chauncey, who had undertaken to provide transportation
for visitors. The Parry Brothers closed in 1918 at the time of World
War I, resumed business in 1920 and worked out a ten-day round
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
trip for visitors from Cedar City via Zion, Kaibab, North Rim,
Bryce and Panguitch back to Cedar City. This round trip with
variations was maintained until 1923, when the Utah Parks
Company acquired part, and in 1927, all of the Parry and Wylie
interests.</p>
<p>Southern Utah scenic attractions were spotlighted with the
visit of President Warren G. Harding to Zion Canyon, June 27,
1923, en route across country toward Alaska, a journey from
which the President was not to return alive. The report of his
trip was spread throughout the nation. Everything had been
planned in advance. A group of seventy-five local Paiute Indians
in gaudy attire was conspicuously at hand. The party was transferred
from the station to twenty-four automobiles and started
south over the newly smoothed earth and gravel roads leading
to Zion Canyon. The caravan, including the cars of many local
leaders, stretched out at least five miles and the dust much farther.</p>
<p>A stop was made at Anderson&rsquo;s Ranch where the best of the
Dixie peaches and other fruits were sampled. At Toquerville
hundreds had congregated to honor the first President of the
United States to visit their section of the country. Harding spoke
from a flag-draped platform and then the procession went on,
passed through Rockville, where the streets were lined with onlookers,
to Springdale where it was welcomed by a fife and drum
corps led by John Dennett and O. D. Gifford playing many of the
tunes they had once used to welcome Brigham Young on his journeys.</p>
<p>At the entrance to the Park, they were welcomed by mounted
rangers and by an orchestra and chorus from Dixie College at St.
George. At the Wylie Camp, they were cheered by five hundred
local people and tourists and serenaded by the college musicians
during lunch. After the meal, the caravan proceeded to the end
of the road at the Grotto campground, and twenty-four men, including
the President, went horseback two miles farther to the
foot of the cable. The caravan then retraced its route to Cedar
City, where in the evening, both President and Mrs. Harding
gave short talks to the assembled multitude before bidding farewell
and boarding their train. The trip had been unmarred by
trouble of any kind and seemed to have been immensely enjoyed.</p>
<p>Before leaving Washington, President Harding had signed a
proclamation making Bryce Canyon a national monument, but
had left it under the direction of the U. S. Forest Service in the
Department of Agriculture. The transfer to the Department of
Interior was to come later. The Forest Service went ahead with
plans for its development.</p>
<p>By 1923, passable auto roads reached Zion, Kaibab, North
Rim, Bryce Canyon, and Cedar Breaks, but some of the routes
were circuitous and it required a great deal of extra travel to
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
make the loop. Thus the road from La Verkin to Zion had to be
retraced in order to go from Hurricane to Pipe Springs, while to
reach Cedar Breaks a special side trip was necessary from either
Parowan or Cedar City, and to get back to Cedar City from Bryce
required a routing through Panguitch and Paragonah. Popular
demand was growing for shorter and more direct routes as well as
for better roads.</p>
<p>During Governor Bamberger&rsquo;s administration, (1917-1921),
a bond issue of $6,000,000 was earmarked to build a concrete
highway south to St. George, but funds were exhausted before
Provo was reached. Under Governor Charles R. Mabey (1921-1925),
gravel roads were stressed in place of the more expensive
concrete, and a gasoline tax to replace state and county road
taxes was enacted into law, but the road to St. George had never
been completed. A solution was proposed in 1924 at a meeting
attended by G. G. Armstrong, Lafayette Hanchett, A. W. Ivins.
George A. Smith, W. J. Halloran and Randall Jones, altruistic
Utah citizens. The scheme proposed that each of the southern
counties be given a quota of $5,000 and Salt Lake City, $10,000,
to be raised through the chambers of commerce. This money was
used by the State Road Commission to match federal funds for
building the road over the black ridge between Ash Creek and
Pintura in Washington County.</p>
<p>Federal aid for roads had been available since 1916, but
complications between state and federal rights and prerogatives
delayed cooperation. By 1923, the Federal Bureau of Public
Roads and the State Road Commission were both studying the
problem of linking the scenic points of southern Utah and northern
Arizona. B. J. Finch of the Bureau of Public Roads and
Howard C. Means, Utah State Road Engineer, investigated the
possibilities of a short-cut from Zion eastward toward Mt. Carmel
or Kanab. In early June, 1923, they arrived at Orderville and
rode horseback with two local guides along the east rim of Zion
seeking a possible outlet. From study of topographic sheets,
they had already conceived a possible route up Parunuweap
Canyon. Failing here, they drove around to Zion Canyon via
Kanab, Pipe Springs and Hurricane. Walter Ruesch, acting Superintendent
of Zion, suggested that they confer with John Winder,
the man best acquainted with the &ldquo;lay of the land&rdquo; who already
had ideas on the subject.</p>
<p>In 1880, when only ten years old, Winder had climbed the
old Indian trail out of Zion where he later (1896) built the first
East Rim Trail. He remembered that &ldquo;old man Newman&rdquo; of
Rockville had always contended that timber could be brought
down from Cedar Mountain if a road could be bored through
the cliffs of Zion. Winder had explored every outlet and was
convinced that there was only one possibility: a road up Pine
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
Creek to the cliff and a tunnel opening in the Great Arch and
coming out into the canyon above the cliff.</p>
<p>Means and Finch found Winder running logs down the
cable. He immediately suggested the Pine Creek route and tunnel.
The next day, the three men studied Pine Creek and the
possible route up to the Arch. Winder then took them horseback
to his ranch on the East Rim, via East Rim Trail. They walked
down Pine Creek afoot to the top of the cliff. Encountering difficulties
of grade and outlet at the top, they studied alternative
possibilities and finally evolved the route now followed by the
present road and tunnel.</p>
<p><i>The Salt Lake Tribune</i> (June 25 and 26, 1923) published a
sensational report of their investigations, but there was much
skepticism in and out of official circles. In the end, however, the
Pine Creek route was finally selected because it traversed the
National Park, where federal funds would be available without
being matched by the state.</p>
<p>Congressman Louis C. Crampton of Michigan, chairman of
the House Committee for the National Park Service, took a personal
interest in the route and tunnel and sponsored the appropriations
that made it possible. During the planning and construction
of this superb highway, which was to become an attraction second
only to the canyon itself, Crampton made several trips to the park
to watch its progress.</p>
<p>Since it was realized that the Pine Creek route would be years
in building, several short-cuts were provided. A road connecting
Cedar Breaks with Highway 89 on the summit between Hatch
and Glendale was opened in 1923 so that parties making the loop
could return to Cedar City via Cedar Breaks instead of Panguitch
and Paragonah. In 1924, another cutoff was made from
Rockville to the plains leading to Pipe Springs, thus eliminating
the long trip down river to Hurricane and back. This road was
firmly financed by a contribution of $5,000 from Stephen T.
Mather.</p>
<p>In the Park itself, a road was surveyed from the cable up-canyon
and was finished to the Temple of Sinawava in the spring
of 1925. From that point on to the Narrows where the walls
close in to leave room only for the river, a foot path, one mile in
length, was constructed. Simultaneously three other trails were
constructed: one to the West Rim, one to the top of Lady Mountain
(Mount Zion) and one along the east bench under the cliffs
from Wylie Grove in both directions. The next year, a trail
to the top of Angel Landing was constructed and two suspension
bridges across the river were installed and the trails opened to
Emerald Pool.</p>

<p>When the Utah Parks Company took over the Wylie camp
in Zion, it was planned to construct a large hotel, but Director
Mather firmly refused permission. He finally agreed to the lodge
and cabin system, now serving the Park tourists. El Escalante
Hotel in Cedar City was ready by the season of 1924. New accommodations
were under construction in Bryce Canyon and
Cedar Breaks. Reports from elated visitors, improvement of
roads and accommodations and consistent advertising all resulted
in vastly increased travel. The tourist traffic jumped from 8400
in 1924 to 16,817 in 1925. About half that number visited North
Rim and presumably Bryce and Cedar Breaks. The tide was in
full flow. For the season of 1925 new tourist busses with demountable
tops for viewing the spectacular canyon walls were
purchased. Busses, however, served only a small part of the
traveling public, for America was on wheels and the roads were
now such that auto traffic could roll in easily. The Grotto Campground
was enlarged, equipped, and supplied with water. The
survey of the Pine Creek road and tunnel was completed and
Wayne Wonderland was dedicated.</p>
<p>Richard Evans was borrowed from the U.S. Geological Survey
and served as acting superintendent during the tourist season for
two years, while Walter Ruesch remained in charge during the
balance of the year. Two permanent park rangers assisted
Ruesch, Donald J. Jolley, appointed August 1, 1920, and Harold
Russell, who had worked summers from 1920 to 1923 and who
received permanent appointment in October of the latter year.
All three were closely associated with developments and improvements
in the canyon. In 1927, E. T. Scoyen was appointed
permanent superintendent.</p>
<p>The Nature Guide Service in Yosemite and Yellowstone had
proved so successful that it was decided to extend such services
to other parks. It was initiated in Zion by the writer, June 19,
1925, and continued to mid-September. There was no precedent
to follow, but the work gradually grew through succeeding summers
into the Naturalist Service. During the next five summers,
museum collections of natural history specimens, pioneer relics,
and library books gradually accumulated and a museum was
established in 1928. Information concerning the history, flora,
fauna and geology of the canyon was collated. Lectures at the
camp ground, at the Lodge, and the guided trips along the Narrows
trail were developed and pictures and lantern slides were shown.
In 1929, a mimeographed publication, the <i>Zion-Bryce Nature
Notes</i>, was undertaken and a Natural History Association was
organized to handle publications.</p>
<p>In 1926, daily bus service was established from Cedar City
around the loop to Zion, North Rim and Bryce. The East and
West Rim trails were reconstructed with better grades and locations.
The West Rim Trail was dedicated at a ceremony held
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
at the time of the visit of Crown Prince Gustavus and Princess
Louise of Sweden, on July 11. A new road was constructed
between Rockville and the Park boundary and the proposed
Parunuweap road was surveyed.</p>
<p>In 1927, the Utah Parks Company took over the Wylie
Camps at North Rim and the bus service from the Parry Brothers,
and a lodge and cabins were constructed on the brink of North
Rim at Bright Angel Point, so arranged that the Great View into
Grand Canyon could be seen from the windows. This was completed
in 1928.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bryce Canyon was being developed by the
Utah Parks Company under the direction of the Forest Service, in
the expectation that eventually it would be transferred to the Park
Service. The lodge and cabins were built some distance from
the rim so that the beauties of the canyon could be preserved to
best advantage. When Mather yielded to pressure to allow
Bryce Canyon to become a national park if all private holdings
were eliminated, Congress passed a bill, June 7, 1924, providing
for the establishment of a Utah National Park upon the fulfillment
of Mather&rsquo;s conditions. The principal difficulty was that the
State of Utah owned a section of land at a strategic point on the
rim of the canyon. It took four years to fulfill the conditions,
and before they were arranged Congress passed a revised bill.
February 25, 1928, nearly doubling the size of the area and changing
its name to Bryce Canyon.</p>
<p>When it became certain that the conditions would be fulfilled,
the Union Pacific arranged for a large excursion (September 14-17,
1928). The party included: Carl R. Gray, president of the
railroad; Stephen T. Mather, Director of the U. S. National Park
Service, and Horace M. Albright, his assistant; Henry H. Blood,
Chairman of the Utah State Road Commission (later Governor of
Utah, 1933-1941); Congressmen Don B. Colton from Utah, and
Philip D. Swing of California; Mayor John F. Bowman of Salt
Lake City; Charles F. Burke, U. S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs;
Thomas H. McDonald, Chief of the U. S. Bureau of Public
Roads; Heber J. Grant, President of the Mormon Church, and his
counselor, Anthony W. Ivins; representatives of the press, chambers
of commerce and other organizations, and a host of lesser
officials and advisers, including the writer.</p>
<p>After spending the first night in Zion, the party journeyed
via Pipe Springs to the Kaibab and North Rim, where on September
15, 1928, the new Kaibab Trail and the Grand Canyon
Lodge were dedicated. The next day the visitors reached Bryce
Canyon where similar services were held in the evening. Congressman
Don B. Colton formally presented deeds of the private
land to Director Mather, who declared that the conditions having
been fulfilled, Bryce Canyon had become a National Park.</p>

<p>Thus the great scenic areas of southern Utah had finally been
established as national parks and monuments, adequate roads
and travel accommodations had been provided, and efforts had
been made to give the casual tourist a deeper appreciation of the
natural treasures at his disposal. Within the next few years many
of the immediate projects for facilitating travel through the Park
area were completed. The bridge across the Marble Gorge of
Grand Canyon, a few miles below Lee&rsquo;s Ferry, was dedicated
June 15, 1929.</p>
<p>The next year saw the official opening of the Zion-Mt. Carmel
highway, one of the most spectacular engineering feats in the history
of road-building. From the canyon floor the road turns to the
east up Pine Creek Canyon and spirals upward on a four-mile roadway
to a tunnel paralleling the face of the vertical cliffs for 5,613
feet. Five galleries cut from the tunnel to the canyon wall offer
the motorist vantage points for viewing the awe-inspiring scenery.
Construction within the National Park cost $2,000,000; from the
Park to Mt. Carmel a state and federal project, also cut in great
part from solid rock, cost in excess of $500,000. Still later the road
up the floor of Zion from the checking station on the main highway
was reconstructed and made a modern oil-surfaced highway. Thereafter,
until America&rsquo;s entry into World War II, each summer
brought greater throngs of visitors into the wonderland.</p>
<p class="tb">At long last the nation had awakened to the greatness of the
gift nature had bestowed upon it, and in future years unnumbered
generations will come to marvel at the wonders of the country
which is southern Utah and at the austere majesty of the Great
White Throne&mdash;generations free from the dread and superstition
that made primitive races fear its unimagined heights no less than
its long shadows and dazzling brilliance in the sun.</p>
<p>Symbol of Nature&rsquo;s handiwork, this central and most magnificent
of Zion&rsquo;s features still echoes the distant footfall of Spanish
padre and American Frontiersmen passing unwittingly by its
dooryard; it is mindful of the day when the first Mormon pioneer
lifted uncomprehending eyes to the solitude of its summit, and of
that other day when religious fervor called it Zion, the dwelling
place of peace. Men have come, cutting their trails, building their
roads, roofing their shelters, dreaming their dreams. The human
tide around its base has ebbed and flowed, according to human
wont, but it remains serene, aloof, alone. It will be so a thousand
years from now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">EPILOGUE</span></h2>
<p>Twenty-one years after Bryce Canyon became a national
park, a &ldquo;coming of Age&rdquo; party was celebrated at Bryce Canyon
on September 15, 1949. The Utah Parks Company acted as
host. The Park Service cooperated by inviting to the celebration
all those that could be found who were present at the dedication
in 1928.</p>
<p>The guests began arriving at Bryce Canyon the day before
the celebration. A group that met in the dining room that evening
included M. R. Tillotson, Regional Director of the Park Service;
P. P. Patraw, Assistant Director and former Superintendent of
Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks; Dr. Harold C. Bryant,
Superintendent of Grand Canyon National Park; Dr. Angus
M. Woodbury, Professor of Zoology, University of Utah,
formerly Park Naturalist of Zion and Bryce; their wives and
Mr. Victor Petrosso, formerly manager of El Tovar Lodge at
Grand Canyon. Others arrived next day including B. J. Finch,
formerly District Engineer of the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads;
W. P. Rogers, Manager of the Utah Parks Company; Joel L.
Priest, Jr. and E. C. Schmidt of the Union Pacific; Mr. and Mrs.
David Rust of Provo, Utah; Mr. and Mrs. M. V. Walker,
Naturalist of Zion and Bryce National Parks; Jack Christensen
of Cedar City; D. C. Dix of the Salt Lake Tribune; and other
officials of the Park Service and Utah Parks Company, making
a total of 41. Many other invited guests expressed regret at
not being able to attend. Those that were present at both the
1928 and 1949 celebrations included the Tillotsons, Finch, Woodbury,
Christensen, Schmidt and the Rusts.</p>
<p>Festivities started at noon with a luncheon in the Lodge
dining room, after which, about 40 guests were taken on a tour
in an ultra modern luxurious Utah Parks bus by Park Naturalist
M. V. Walker along the Bryce Rim as far as Rainbow Point and
Yovimpa View where everyone enjoyed the friendly greetings
of old acquaintances, the superb natural sculptures and the marvelous
vistas from the high points where the Aquarius Plateau,
the Henry Mountains, the Kaiparowits Plateau, Navajo Mountain
and the Kaibab were all to be seen in the unsurpassed landscape.</p>
<p>At 7 p.m., the group converged on the superintendent&rsquo;s
residence where Mr. and Mrs. Smith held open house and dispensed
hospitality lavishly.</p>
<p>At 8:15 p.m., the group moved to the lodge dining room
where a sumptuous banquet given by the Utah Parks Company
was followed by a program at which Superintendent Smith presided
and interestingly introduced the speakers. Ranger in
charge, John G. Lewis gave the address of welcome. Reminiscences
of the early days in the Utah National Parks were related
by Dr. Woodbury, who also referred to the outstanding work
which Mr. B. J. Finch, formerly of the Bureau of Public Roads,
did in pioneering the Zion-Mt Carmel Highway and Tunnel.</p>

<p>Mr. Tillotson gave the main speech of the evening, in which
he called attention to the great growth in travel into Bryce from
21,977 in 1929 to 189,493 in 1949, and pointed to the fine work
of the Utah Parks Company in making this possible. He also
reported that Dr. Thomas H. McDonald, Commissioner of
the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, who had been present in
1928 but could not come in 1949, wrote that &ldquo;Bryce Canyon, since
I first saw it, has been to me one of the most delightful places in
the West. I have long felt that a vacation road from Southwest
Colorado crossing the Colorado River and coming into Bryce
Canyon through Escalante, if properly developed and controlled,
offers the best opportunity in the west ...&rdquo; and thus kindled a
fire under the hopes of all Bryce enthusiasts for it would open
up the heart of the great scenic area of southeastern Utah, of
which, Zion, Bryce and Wayne Wonderland are on the outskirts.</p>
<p>Mr. W. P. Rogers responded with a witty talk about old
times, spoke of the fine cooperation of the Park Service and
proposed a further reunion in another five years.</p>
<p>The next day, the writer retraced old trails in Zion Canyon
and visited the museum and park headquarters where Naturalist
Walker explained the developments taking place. Especially
prominent was the great increase in the literature available to
the public provided by the Natural History Association that had
been organized by the writer in 1929. This included pictures,
colored slides and publications, among which the works of Dr.
H. E. Gregory on the geology of the region were outstanding.</p>

written on both trips of 1826 and 1827. This upsets the idea that he named it
for Thomas Virgin, a member of his party. George C. Yount, as recorded in

the Spanish Trail and doubtless the name was given between 1827 and 1844.
In Fremont&rsquo;s time, the Muddy River was called &ldquo;Rio de Los Angeles,&rdquo; and the

working cooperatively together. In order to make for efficiency in the social
group, each one was expected to do voluntarily and with unquestioning obedience
the part assigned by the leaders. Thus individuals were usually &ldquo;called&rdquo;
to go on missions, to fill an office, to go as a colonist, to work on the temple or
any other unusual problem. The &ldquo;call,&rdquo; at least in the early days, was practically
a command.

John J. Allred. Charlie Klapper soon left and Albert and George Petty and
Hardin Whitlock moved over to Springdale during the winter of 1862-63. In

placed it about &#8537; mile above the lodge, on a flat since washed away by
the river. E. C. Behunin, after an absence of 57 years, placed it near the forks
of the road that lead to the lodge and swimming pool. He was evidently mistaken,
for his description of the location of his father&rsquo;s farm seems to indicate
that Gifford&rsquo;s location is correct. He was certain that the old river meander
just north of the lodge (now artificially filled in) was not there in the early days,
but the physical evidences before straightening the river and building the permanent
road definitely indicate that it was. Heap&rsquo;s farm, which he says was separated
from his father&rsquo;s by the river, was above this meander. James H. Jennings,
who owned the place afterward, says that Behunin was mistaken. (Interview
with James Jennings at Rockville, Utah, August 15, 1933).

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
